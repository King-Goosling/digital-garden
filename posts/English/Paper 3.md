# Paper 3
## 1st QN
*If you are in the scene in the video, how would you feel?*

Make use of the video. Scrutinise the details of the video to make better use out of the video.
## 2nd & 3rd QN
#### 2nd qn: Opinion qn
*What makes a great transport service?*
#### 3rd qn: Stand (similar to paper 1 qns)
*'XXX'. Do you agree?*

When talking about your stand, you can talk about the opposite stand as well. Just keep in mind not to structure it like your stand, but to mention as someone else's stand.

For example, you can say "However, not all people would XXX" or "Some may say that YYY (and rebut it later)"
