# Essay ideas
## Technology
### Internet
#### Bad
##### Anonymity (for crime)
Grants anonymity, just like ==Ring of Gyges==

Invisibility is granted to a shepherd called Gyges
- Gyges then seduces the queen, kills the king, and takes over his kingdom

There is no authority, nor punishment for Gyges' crimes
##### Lack of privacy
Corporate behemoths like Facebook stores users' data

==Facebook Beacon== is Facebook's advertisement system where external websites sends data to Facebook to personalise advertisements.
- led to ==Lane v. Facebook== (Facebook lost, and Facebook Beacon is terminated)
##### Spawn of fake news

###### growth in Anti-vax sentiments
An anti-vaxxer cosplayed as a zombie with fake blood in protest against vaccines, known as the =='Seattle Zombie Woman'==
$\rightarrow$ police turned up to arrest the woman, only to realise the woman was not actually injured
$\rightarrow$ time and resources are wasted
### E-book vs physical book
#### Physical book > E-book
1. Mental map-making (navigation for certain resources and info in the book)
    -  $\rightarrow$ easy to reread
    - $\rightarrow$ can read deeply
    - $\uparrow$ learn more (from reading)
 
2. Less eye-straining
- People blink less when looking at screens
    - $\rightarrow$ eyes dry out and become sore easily
  
3. Read slower
- People have a habit to read faster on screen (social media is full of short messages and fast-moving videos)
    - $\rightarrow$ people will tend to skim through
    - $\rightarrow$ read less deeply
#### E-book > Physical
1. More enviromentally friendly
2. Cheaper
3. More convenient
    - to carry around (a small phone as opposed to thick books)
    - to read (adjust font and size however you want)
        - beneficial to dyslexic people (they read better in a font called Open Dyslexic)
        - beneficial to elderlies (increase font size for better reading)
4. Useful tools
    - TTS (text to speech)
    - highlight
    - pop-up definitions
#### Solutions
1. Write notes to understand deeply.
That is the point of reading: learning something new.

 2. Turn off notifications and place a restriction on some applications to $\uparrow$ concentration
### Continuous partial attention

### A.I. and jobs
Tools like ==DALL-E and Midjourney== are A.I. that generates art from the keywords you type
- a person submitted A.I.-generated art to an art contest and won first place
    - $\rightarrow$ public outrage and online debate
    - $\rightarrow$ some artists worry about their job security
## Environment
### Effect of the pandemic
While human activies have attenuated, nature is finally allowed to take over and reign free throughout the pandemic. This is known as the ==anthropause==

The effects have been observed by ecologists to better understand anthropogenic effects on the environment
$\rightarrow$ tour operators realise the environmental harm they contributed to unknowingly
$\rightarrow$ take action and impose more restrictions
$\uparrow$ environmentally-friendly
#### Good
1. Marine life improved (lesser snorkelers)
2. More land as habitat (urban areas are no longer noisy and animals start roaming near there)
3. Communication of birds improved (lesser noise pollution)
#### Bad
1. More vehicles hit animals (animals start roaming near roads)
2. Habitats once protected by humans are destroyed by predators (no humans to protect)
### Land use
To prioritise the environment or not to prioritise?
#### Yes
1. Have something to pass down to our descendents.
    - Trees and natural habitats will be scarce in the future
        - Let our descendents see the beauty of nature rather then in digital or written forms
2. Preserve the wildlife
    - ==We share this world with nature==. We must respect and protect nature.
    - If we don't destroy natural habitats, animals have no way to go and they will perish
3. Keep the climate in balance
    - ==Nature is a finely tuned machine==. There will be repercussions such as droughts if we tamper too much with nature.
        - So, we should not remove so much trees. Trees are important in regulating $CO_2$ too.
#### Solution
1. Use land more effectively, instead of increasing land use
    - Build taller and deeper (more basements) buildings
    - Build trees on top of buildings
    - Build land over the sea
### Why is there no change?
#### Government's reluctance
Some countries like Britain made energy use management an **individual's choice**
(Even though a majority of Britains welcome a mandatory energy use reduction)

*Why?*
(general speculation)
1. afraid of being seen as 'patronising'
2. may imply that the govt. has failed to ensure energy security
#### Water use for irrigation in agriculture
Water used for irrigation is significantly more than human consumption, esp. in ==America West==
$\rightarrow$ **little to no point for citizens to reduce water usage**
### Effect of environmental damage
1. Book printing is changing
    - words are closer tgt, spacings and indents are shrunk
2. Publishers prefer publishing shorter books over longer books
    - but people can read easier ($\downarrow$ struggle with long chunks of text)
## Social
### Authority
#### For
##### Stable society
>[!summary] Ring of Gyges: Grant total invisibility at willl
>
Invisibility is granted to a shepherd called Gyges
Gyges then seduces the queen, kills the king, and takes over his kingdom
>
No authority,
No punishment,
wielder incentivised to perpetrate crimes (no risk, high reward)

Singapore is dubbed as =='Disneyland with the death penalty' by William Gibson==

==Pragmatism in Singapore==: death penalty to drug offences
1. Prevent drugs from tearing families apart
    - One life is sacrificed to save an entire family
2. Land is conserved (Singapore has little land too)
    - Even after death penalty is imposed, a lot of drug traffickers still come to Singapore
    $\rightarrow$ lesser offenders, lesser land used for jails
#### Against
##### No freedom
1. cannot speak out
    - media censorship
    - splinternet in Russia China Iran
    - dictatorship silence opposition
    $\rightarrow$ **no change for the better**
2. $\downarrow$ sharing of ideas
    - $\downarrow$ innovation
    - $\downarrow$ **society progress**
### Education
#### Inequality due to wealth
##### Shadow education
Precocity granted to children of wealthier families.

Wealthier families
$\rightarrow$ can afford to send their children to tuition very early in life
$\rightarrow$ afford to participate in **shadow education** (e.g. private tuitions)
$\rightarrow$ ossification of effective learning habits + basic academic concepts
$\rightarrow$ early boost and headstart in academic knowledge
Overall, $\uparrow$ academics compared to poorer children
##### Prestigious schools
Priorites given to SG citizens, then distance when applying to a primary school.
$\rightarrow$ houses near prestigious schools are more expensive
$\rightarrow$ wealthier families can afford to settle there

Prestigious primary schools affiliated to prestigious secondary schools
$\uparrow$ chance to secure place in prestigious schools
##### As a result,
$\uparrow$ academics
$\uparrow$ earning power
$\rightarrow$ repeat the cycle (wealthy families produce wealthy descendents)
==Restrictive social mobility within generations==

Pedagogical inequality: ==Glass ceiling above the poorer families.== Different groups of society have different education opportunities
### Crime
Anyone can be a malefactor. It's not limited to certain race or culture.
#### Examples
==Blue collar crimes==: murder, robbery, assault, drug-trafficking
- Singapore: Malay couple splash hot water on 5-year-old son $\rightarrow$ died from scalds

==White collar crimes==: embezzlement, swindling, fraud, cybercrime
- South Korea: Samsung heir embezzled numerous times
- Singapore: Hacktivists defaced the webpage of ==Prime Minister's Office== and ==Istana== in ==2013==

South Korea is dominated by giant conglomerates known as ==chaebols==
$\rightarrow$ important for economy
$\rightarrow$ sentences were lightened, and crimes were even pardoned
#### Solutions
1. $\uparrow$ employment opportunities
    - $\downarrow$ incentive to rob people ($\uparrow$ money)
2. teach from young
    - school show videos of malefactors expressing remorse
    - field trips
    - define crimes - what is a crime and what is not
        - a handful of students in SG already attempted to shoplift
3. law enactment and enforcement
    - seal loopholes
    - $\uparrow$ risk of being caught and punished, $\downarrow$ incentive to commit crimes (not worth it)
### Relevance of newspapers
#### Not
1. Not instant
    - inferior to online news like ==The Straits Times== and ==Lianhe Zaobao==
    - real-time updates are important and crucial (onset of war / lockdown)
2. Hard to refer back and find old articles
    - waste of time to shuffle through stacks of newspapers
    - inefficient way to store articles (as compared to digitally)
3. A lot of censorship and propaganda
    - media censorship in ==Singapore, Russia, and China==
        - ==The Straits Times== are pro-govt. and publish articles that promote govt.'s stance
        - China govt. attempted to cover up the ==Tiananmen Square Massacre==
4. STILL PRONE TO FAKE NEWS
    - ==The Leeds 13== staged a holiday trip, seemingly funded by grants given to them
       $\rightarrow$ UK magazines went with the story and criticised them
       $\rightarrow$ turns out, the trip was a hoax
       $\rightarrow$ lesson learnt: fake news can spread easily due to hectic nature of newspapers and lack of careful analysis
#### Is
1. Factually correct as newspapers are usually owned by govt.
    - less prone to =='digital echo chamber'== and =='filter bubbles'==
        - info that coincides with users' opinion will be fed to them more (even factually incorrect ones)
          $\rightarrow$ people will believe them due to ==confirmation bias== (bias of preferring info that is coextensive with our believes)
    - less prone to fake news, and therefore less resources wasted
        - E.g.: ==All Singapore Stuff (A.S.S.)== publish a news article about collapsed roof at ==Punggol Waterway Terraces==
          $\rightarrow$ panicked residents, SPF, SCDF, went to investigate the matter
          $\rightarrow$ govt. resources + civilians' time wasted
    - less prone to misinformation
        - the taste map is printed in many textbooks
            - It states that only certain parts of the tongue can feel certain tastes (e.g. sweetness cannot be tasted at the back of the tongue)
            - This is false. The taste map just shows the areas of the tongue which are more sensitive to the respective tastes
            - Factual information is warped due to human error like 'broken telephone' game, especially translation error (German to English)
            - Misinformation is widely spread and believed as
                - It offers a good story. It makes people believe it even though it is contradicted by facts.
                - ==We should have healthy skepticism==
### Care for the elderly
#### For
A =='dementia village' was built in Netherlands== to mimick a village setting for elderlies with dementia to live in
- much enriching as compared to sterile and clinical settings in nursing homes
$\rightarrow$ elderlies can live the last moments of their lives happily and normally
### Relationships
*'We must build relationships with everyone.' How far do you agree?*
#### For: Social capital
Better relationships,
People work together better

1. More employees report to work (more friends, more interesting, more incentive)
2. Better cooperation with colleagues ($\uparrow$ business)
3. Help each other in need (e.g. Stay Home Notice, help to buy groceries)
#### For: Parents and children
Unlike friends, parent-children relationships can never be seperated - parents and children will always be connected by blood.

By having good parent-children relationships, we can practise love everyday. We can learn how to love - which is one of the most beautiful things in life.

>[!summary] Porcupine dilemma
Porcupines huddle together to keep themselves warm during winter. However, they cannot huddle too close as their sharp quills may prick each other.
>
Just like humans, we desire close relationships, yet our differences (political stances, opinions, etc.) force us to seperate.

%%
#### Embrace differences
*How do we build good relationships with others?*

We should huddle together in spite of our quills. We ==must embrace our differences== so that we can build close relationships with others.%%
#### Against: we cannot rely too much on relationships
Instead of deciding whether to huddle or spread out, we should manage our desire to seek warmth - seek for relationships.
##### unhealthy relationships < No relationships
Sometimes, the pain from the quills is not worth the warmth; sometimes, the person may be too immoral. ==Perhaps we should build close relationships with others because 'we want to' instead of 'we have to'.== (e.g. FoMO: Fear of Missing Out)

We can abandon the weak and unwanted relationships to make space for closer ones. After all, internal warmth may be enough for some. ==It is sometimes better to be alone, than cling to unhealthy relationships.==
##### Practise independence
We can better practise independence too, and stop overly relying on others for help.
### Latchkey children
Children who comes back to an empty home, from school, due to ==dual income== and ==increasing single-parent families== (as opposed to nuclear families)
#### Good
- Independent
    - esp. compared to 'helicopter children', coined from parents supervising their children's every move like a helicopter
    - can do whatever they want
#### Bad
- Boredom, hostility from lack of supervision
    - may aggravate to a situation where they concede to peer pressure and commit vices (smoking, drinking, etc.)
- Depression and lower self-esteem ($\uparrow$ opportunities for harmful self-talk)
#### Neutral
- Both have similar academic grades according to a PISA study in 2000
### Rashomon effect
Similar to ==blind men and an elephant==, different people have different accounts of the same incident
### Soldiers of war
#### Diffusion/Displacement of responsibility
A sociopsychological phenomenon

==E.g. WWII==
Nazis commit atrocities without guilt + not help out / harm victims because they believe that they were just following orders (on top of threats by Nazi officials)
#### Victims too
During the rule of the ==Khmer Rogue==, the Khmer Rogue perpetrate atrocities such as torture.

However, the lower ranks of Khmer Rogue members lived in fear under their superiors too. They commit immoral acts so that they will stay alive.
### Thalidomide
Made in ==Germany==.

Deemed as the magic bullet to a range of illnesses including morning sickness, it was taken by a lot of people especially pregnant women.

It caused severe birth defects. However, it was thanks to ==Dr Kelsey=='s resolution that she was able to ==keep it off US== and saved it from a National Health Crisis.
### Happiness
#### Pain and happiness
It does not mean being happy all the time. Rather, it is being able to ==embrace painful experiences==.

Buddhist quote: =="Existence is Suffering"==
If you try to avoid suffering, it will have control over you.

==Things do not always happen for the best. But we can learn to make best of the things that happen.==
#### Antifragile
Resistance is being able to withstand stress and remain unfazed

Antifragile is bouncing back stronger after facing stress

Similar to ==training muscles in gym==
#### Paradox of Happiness
Prioritise and value happiness, you become less happy. 

Happiness is a good thing. Valuing it is not.
##### ANalogy of sunlight
Look at sunlight directly, it hurts your eye. Use a prism to refract the individual rays, you can admire the rainbow shined from the prism.

Looking at sunlight directly is harmful, looking at it oliquely is beneficial.
##### Lesson
Happiness is a lifelong goal. Set realistic expectations rather than unrealistic ones.

==“The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance, while the wise man grows it under his feet”== Seek realistic happiness from within, rather than unrealistic happiness from afar.
