# Essay guide
## Plan
PLAN FIRST
### Brain dump
1. Write whatever ideas you have on the topic.
2. Organise your ideas to form individual paragraphs.
3. Cull irrelevant ideas.
### Think out of the box
Think about common misconceptions/assumptions, reasons/causes, effects/implications, etc.
### Explore the topic
Think about the bigger picture. Think about the different viewpoints, or pros and cons, or problems and solutions.

Weigh them up near the end of the essay in order to conclude well.
### Define the essay prompt
Keywords in essay prompts can be subjective. Take this for example:
>Is it always important to succeed?

What does succeed here mean? Financially? Leading a fulfilling life? 

Discuss the definition at the introduction, then start writing your points.

==Don't write this for the sake of writing it.== This definition should help you in some way.
## Introduction
Review this after you are done with your essay. Double check that it is still relevant (just in case you made changes to your points along the way).
### Write your definition of essay prompt
When discussing the points, ==link back to this paragraph if possible==.
### Explore the topic in the introduction
Describe the aspects of the topics you are talking about. For example,
- pros and cons
- problems and solutions

This can help in
- reducing biasness (two views are addressed)
- showing clear understanding and critical thinking (wide range of knowledge covered)
## Language
### Be concise
There's no point using redundant metaphors or 'deep' phrases/quotes. For example,
>If teenagers disregard schedules, their discipline will be reduced to nothingness.

A better, simpler alternative would be
>If teenagers disregard schedules, they will lose their discipline

==Write clearly for yourself, and the examiner.== Use simpler and more concise words.
### Stop repeating/paraphrasing
Especially in the introductory paragraph, don't tell an entire story just to prelude your essay. ==Keep it short and sweet.== Content is more important than the first paragraph

==Do not repeat/paraphrase what you have previously said.== Avoid being repetitive and make your essay hard to read.

Doing so would allow your essay to be denser with content, and less diluted with redudant words. This would make your essay more enjoyable to read, and allow you to write more content.
### Sentence structure
Think about what your sentence will be, before writing it down. Consider whether it is the most efficient way to write it - if not, shift the clauses around to give it a better flow. Seperate them into individual sentences works too.
### Be more engaging
Dipense with the formal language. Being more lively and exurberant will make your essay more attractive.
### Tone
Don't be accusatory. You just need to write a clear essay. Do not to vent your anger.
### Avoid personal pronouns
Don't use
- I/me/one
- you
- we/us
### Use passive voice, not active voice
## Content
### Analyse > Description
Don't describe too much on the example. Give the example short and sweet, and expand from there.
### Organise your points
Don't jumble up your points. For example, if you are talking about how **superstitions** progressed over the years, first write about the ==past==, then the ==present==, and finally the ==future==. You can seperate your points into ==advantages== and ==disadvantages== too.

As for your typical essay with 3 pointers, just write them as it is. 
### Strengthening the argument
Use **analogies**, **questions**, **examples** and **context** to strengthen your argument
#### Analogies
>*Stand: Success is subjective*
>Even if a country had won a moral victory, it has lost the war

>*Stand: Not all violence originate from movies*
>It is safe to assume that Osama Bin Laden's decision to destroy the World Trade Centre was not incited by movies
#### Questions
Questions engages the examiner, and prompts them to think deeply
>*Questioning the definition of success*
>Is success only given to the man who came in first? What about the man who came in second?
#### Examples
Real-life examples, to be exact.
#### Context
Apply the topic into different scenarios. Use this only when context changes the validity of the judgement based on the topic.
## Ending paragraph
Don't rush this. Think carefully about how to end this essay, and give the marker a lasting impression. You can do so by linking back to the [[#Introduction]] in some way, for example.
### Thesis statement
There's no need to fit everything in a single sentence. What's important is that it is integrated into the introductory paragraph well. 
## Reread once you are done
Check for grammatical errors.
