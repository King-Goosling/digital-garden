1. ==Sun's== energy reaches earth

2. ==Earth== heats up -> ==surrounding air== heats up

3. Air **expands**
    -> becomes **less denser**
    -> **rises**

4. Air **rises**
    -> **cools** until ==dew point temp.==
    -> **condense** into water droplets

5. Clouds form, specifically ==Cumulonimbus clouds==[^1], usually

6. When water droplets **large** and **heavy** enough -> **fall** back to earth's surface as ==rain==
