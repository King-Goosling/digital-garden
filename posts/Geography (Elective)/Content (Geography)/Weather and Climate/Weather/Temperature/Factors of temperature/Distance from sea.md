**Sea** experiences ==**maritime effect**==
- heats up more ==slowly== as compared to **land**
- cooler air from **sea** ==lower== temp. of **coastal areas**
->==**Cooler summers**==

**Land** experiences **==continental effect==**
- temp. not affected by sea
->==**Warmer summers**==

## Winter

**Sea** experiences ==**maritime effect**==
- loses heat more ==slowly== as compared to **land**
- warmer air from **sea** ==increases== temp. of **coastal areas**
->==**Warmer winters**==

**Land** experiences **==continental effect==**
- temp. not affected by sea
->==**Cooler winters**==

> ==Sea== experiences cooler summers and warmer winters

> ==Land== experiences warmer summers and cooler winters
> -> $\uparrow$ temp. diff. between **summer** and **winter**
