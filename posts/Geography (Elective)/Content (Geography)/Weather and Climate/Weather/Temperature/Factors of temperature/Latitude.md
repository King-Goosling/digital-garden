> earth is **titled** at ==**23.5Â°**== on its own axis -> ==diff.== **solar angle** on ==diff.== **parts of the world**

## Explanation in terms of solar angle
$\uparrow$ **latitude**,
$\downarrow$ **solar angle** (the angle of incidence at which the sun's rays strike the earth),
$\uparrow$ **area** of land where the sun's rays are **concentrated** on,
$\downarrow$ **solar energy** received in a specific area in that location,
>$\downarrow$ **mean annual temperature**

## Explanation in terms of distance between sun and earth
$\uparrow$ **latitude**,
$\uparrow$ **distance** between the sun's rays and the earth's surface at that location,
$\uparrow$ **loss** of solar radiation,
$\downarrow$ **solar energy** received
>$\downarrow$ **mean annual temperature**
