>==Solar energy== from **sun** travels to **earth's surface** in form of ==**shortwave radiation**==

^02a592
>Earth's surface absorbs and emits it through ==**longwave radiation**==

^76292c
>[!info]
>Shortwave radiation has **shorter wavelengths** and a **higher frequency** than longwave radiation

## Explanation in terms of radiation
$\uparrow$ **altitude**,
$\uparrow$ **distance** from the surface of the earth heated by the sun,
$\uparrow$ **loss** of longwave radiation,
>$\downarrow$ **mean annual temperature**

## Explanation in terms of conc. of atmospheric gases and air particles
$\uparrow$ **altitude**,
$\downarrow$ **density** &
$\downarrow$ **conc**. of atmospheric gases and air particles (which traps heat),
$\downarrow$ **heat gain** from longwave radiation
>$\downarrow$ **mean annual temperature**
