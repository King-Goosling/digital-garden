### Day
Clouds
- ==reflect== most of the **sun's energy (shortwave radiation)[^1]** back into space
- ==absorb== heat radiated from **earth's surface (longwave radiation)[^2]** -> prevent it from escaping into space
-> keeping earth's surface ==cool==
-> ==**cooler days**==

### Night
Clouds
- ==absorb== heat radiated from **earth's surface (longwave radiation)[^2]**  -> prevent it from escaping into space
-> keeping earth's surface ==warm==
-> ==**warmer nights**==

>=> $\downarrow$ difference of temp. between **day** and **night**
>=> $\downarrow$ **diurnal temp. range**

### Day
==Larger== amounts of **sun's energy (shortwave radiation)[^1]** reach earth's surface
-> earth's surface ==warmer==
-> ==**warmer days**==

### Night
==More== heat radiated from **earth's surface (longwave radiation)[^2]** escaping into space
-> earth's surface ==cooler==
-> ==**cooler nights**==

>=> $\uparrow$ difference of temp. between **day** and **night**
>=> $\uparrow$ **diurnal temp. range**
