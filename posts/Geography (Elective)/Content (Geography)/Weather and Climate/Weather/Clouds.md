## Clouds
Earth surface **heats** up
    -> water **evaporates** into water vapour
    -> water vapour **rises**
    -> **cools** to ==dew point temp.== (temp. at which condensation occurs)
    -> **condenses** on tiny particles (also known as ==condensation nuclei==) if present
    -> ==coalescence== occurs (water droplets **merge** and become **larger**)
    -> ==cloud== formed
    (if **large** enough) -> water droplets **fall** to earth's surface as ==precipitation==
