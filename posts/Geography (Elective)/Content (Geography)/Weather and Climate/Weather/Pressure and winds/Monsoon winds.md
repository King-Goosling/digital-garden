>[!info]+ Summer in northern hemisphere, winter in southern hemisphere
>- Surrounding air over ==Central Asia== **heats** up -> **expands** -> becomes **less denser** -> **rises** -> create region of **lower** pressure
>- Surrounding air over ==Australia== **cools** down -> **contracts** -> becomes **denser** -> **sinks** -> create region of **higher** pressure
>
>Air moves from region of **higher** pressure to region of **lower** pressure -> Air moves from ==Australia== to ==Central Asia==

>[!info]+ Coriolis effect
>- as air travels ==Australia== => ==equator==, it deflects to its **left**
>- as air crosses ==equator==, it deflects to its **right**

After crossing equator, wind becomes ==**southwest monsoon winds**== and **warms** up
-> picks **moisture** from ==Indian ocean==
-> brings **heavy rain** to ==Indian sub-continent==

## Northeast monsoon (October to February)
