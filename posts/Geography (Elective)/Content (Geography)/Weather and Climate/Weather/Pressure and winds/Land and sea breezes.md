>==Land== **cools** down **faster** than ==sea== -> ==sea== **warmer** than ==land==
- Surrounding air on ==sea== **heats** up -> **expands** -> becomes **less denser** -> **rises** -> create region of **lower** pressure
- Surrounding air on ==land== **cools** down -> **contracts** -> becomes **denser** -> **sinks** -> create region of **higher** pressure

>Air moves from region of **higher** pressure to region of **lower** pressure
>     -> Air moves from ==land== to ==sea==
