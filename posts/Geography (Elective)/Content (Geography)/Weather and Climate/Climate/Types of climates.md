# Types of climates

| Climates                 | Latitude                            | Mean annual temp. |Annual temp. range                                          | Total annual rainfall |Distribution of rainfall                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------|---------------------------- | -------------------------------------|------------------ |
| Equatorial climate       | Between **10°** N & S of equator        | **High** since ==$\downarrow$ latitude $\uparrow$ mean annual temp.== (**higher** compared to TROPICAL MOONSON CLIMATE) | **Small** since ==$\uparrow$ humdity $\uparrow$ cloud cover== (**smaller** compared to TROPICAL MOONSON CLIMATE)| **High** total annual rainfall since ==$\uparrow$ temp. $\uparrow$ convectional rain== | **NO** distinct wet & dry seasons, **Quite** evenly distributed since it's not so affected by ==monsoon winds $\rightarrow$ some months with $\uparrow$ rainfall==                            |
| Tropical monsoon climate | Between **5°** & **25°**, N & S of equator  | **High** since ==$\downarrow$ latitude $\uparrow$ mean annual temp.== (**smaller** compared to EQUATORIAL CLIMATE) |**Small** since ==$\uparrow$ humidity $\uparrow$ cloud cover== (**higher** compared to EQUATORIAL CLIMATE)    | **High** total annual rainfall since ==$\uparrow$ temp. $\uparrow$ convectional rain== and ==monsoon winds $\rightarrow$ some months with $\uparrow$ rainfall==| Distinct wet & dry seasons, **NOT** evenly distributed since it's more affected by ==monsoon winds $\rightarrow$ some months with $\uparrow$ rainfall== |
| Cool temperate climate   | Between **40°** & **60°**, N & S of equator | **Low** since ==$\uparrow$ latitude $\downarrow$ mean annual temp.== | **Large** due to ==latitude $\rightarrow$ 4 distinct seasons==  | **Low**| **NO** distinct wet & dry seasons, Evenly distributed                                                        |

## Answering technique
It is a ==(climate)== because it is located at ==XX° N/S of equator==, and it experiences
>[!summary]+ ==Temperature== and ==rainfall==:
>**Degree** (high/low?)
>**Characteristic** (Mean annual temp. / annual temp. range / etc.)
>**Value** (at XXX)

and ==(rainfall distribution)==

>[!example] 
>It is an ==equatorial climate==(climate) because it is located at ==6°N==(location) of equator, and it experiences
>- a ==high==(degree) ==mean annual temp.==(characteristic) of ==26°C==(value)
>- a ==small==(degree) ==annual temp. range==(characteristic) of ==17°C==(value)
>- a ==high==(degree) ==total annual rainfall==(characteristic) of ==1600mm==(value)
>
>and ==does not have distinct wet and dry seasons==.
