## International agreements
A contract signed by $\geq$ 2 countries 

**Example**: Kyoto Protocol signed in ==Kyoto, Japan==, in ==**1997**== in order to reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally

>[!success] Successes
>Many countries like ==GIF== (==G==reece, ==I==reland and ==F==inland) have **exceeded** their emission targets set by the Kyoto Protocol
>- Countries required to **monitor** and **report** their greenhouse gas emissions -> ensure on track with keeping to their targets

>[!fail] Limitations
>Still some countries like ==China and India== did not achieve targets + ==USA== still have not signed
>
>- **Not compulsory** for countries to sign nor keep to their emission targets
>
>==China, India and USA== contribute most of global greenhouse gas emissions -> undermine smaller countries' efforts in keeping to their emission targets (little point for them to do so)

## National responses
Government implement policies to better keep to their emission targets set by [[#International agreements]]

### **Examples**
#### Green Mark Scheme launched in 2005
- **evaluates** buildings on how environmentally friendly and energy-efficient they are (provide $=$ services using $\downarrow$ energy -> $\uparrow$ energy-efficient)
- aims to **encourage** more 'green' buildings to be constructed, which are $\uparrow$ energy-efficient

>[!success] Successes
>Existing 'green' buildings like National Library Building reportedly save ==**15%**== to ==**30%**== more energy compared to conventional buildings
>- $\uparrow$ energy saved -> $\downarrow$ energy required -> $\downarrow$ fossil fuels burnt to meet energy demand -> $\downarrow$ carbon dioxide emissions

>[!fail] Limitations
>- Construction companies more ==conservative== about adopting new ideas to build green buildings (rather stick to less energy-efficient and more conventional methods)
>- 'Green' materials required to build 'green' buildings like bamboo, which are ==expensive== -> less attractive to construction companies -> stick to conventional methods with cheaper materials

#### Plant-A-Tree Programme started in 1971
- residents encouraged to **donate** to buy a tree / **take part** in monthly tree-planting events
- aims to maintain Singapore's title as a 'Garden City'

>[!success] Successes
>==**60,000**== trees planted ==**annually**== in Singapore
>- $\uparrow$ trees -> $\uparrow$ more carbon dioxide taken in (during photosynthesis) -> $\downarrow$ carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

>[!fail] Limitations
>Trees that are considered fast-growing like ==raintrees== take a long time to reach their full height at ==**25 years**==
>- slow growth of trees -> takes a long time before they make a significant change in greenhouse gas emissions
