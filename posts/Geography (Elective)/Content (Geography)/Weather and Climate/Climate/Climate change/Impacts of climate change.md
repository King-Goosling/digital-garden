## Rise in sea level
-> increase in ==mean height== of the ==surface== of the sea ==between high and low tides==, relative to ==land==

**Cause**: $\uparrow$ Temp.
-> $\uparrow$ glaciers melt -> $\uparrow$ water in sea -> $\uparrow$ sea level
-> seas gain heat -> expand -> $\uparrow$ sea level

>[!fail] Dangers
>Flood low-lying areas and islands -> no land to stay and live on ->
>- homes and resources lost -> lives lost (if no escape route, esp. islanders)
>- habitats lost -> loss of animals' lives (no suitable habitat)
>
>**Example**: 2/3 of world's largest cities located in coastal areas are at risk if sea level rises
>- loss of homes and resources -> people living there have to relocate
>- loss of jobs (cannot work in flooded city) -> country suffers economically
>  
>  (Problem for DCs - harder to relocate with such buildings and skyscrapers)

## More frequent extreme weather events
==Extreme weather event== is a severe and **rare** weather event that leads to
- severe **economical** losses
- loss of **lives**

**Cause**: $\uparrow$ Temp. -> ==$\uparrow$ water vapour + $\uparrow$ latent heat + $\uparrow$ heat== in atmosphere ($\uparrow$ prone to extreme weather events)

>[!fail] **Example**: Heat wave in Europe 2003, killed tens of thousands of people
>- Not visibly destructive -> kills people silently
>- Body cannot cool itself down from extreme heat -> organs damaged -> may even loss of lives
>- Hard to predict + nearly unavoidable

## Spread of infectious insect-borne diseases
**Cause**: $\uparrow$ temperature + $\uparrow$ rainfall (favourable conditions for insects) -> $\uparrow$ spread of diseases transmissible diseases

>[!fail] Dangers
>**Example**: $\uparrow$ rainfall -> $\uparrow$ aquatic habitats for mosquitoes to thrive in -> $\uparrow$ spread of dengue fever
>
>**Example**: Europe and North America starting to get insect-borne diseases (intially don't have) -> no access to vaccines / medicines for diseases not encountered before ==(problem for LDCs)== -> maybe loss of lives

## Change of growing season
$\uparrow$ temp. -> $\uparrow$ growing season
>[!fail] Disadvantages
>**Example**: $\downarrow$ Average wheat grain yield in Canada
>- $\downarrow$ production of crops -> $\downarrow$ crops sold -> $\downarrow$ economy of Canada

$\uparrow$ temp. -> $\downarrow$ growing season
>[!success] Advantages
>**Example**: $\uparrow$ variety of crops suitable for growth in United Kingdom
>- $\uparrow$ production of crops -> $\uparrow$ crops sold -> $\uparrow$ economy of United KIngdom
