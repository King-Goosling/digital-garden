1. Shortwave radiation **travels** to earth from sun
2. *Some* shortwave radiation **reflected** by ==earth's surface== and ==atmosphere==
3. *Most* shortwave radiation **absorbed** by ==earth's surface==...
4. ...and **emitted** it out as longwave radiation
5. Greenhouse gases in ==atmosphere== **absorb** longwave radiation -> **warm** ==atmosphere==

### Greenhouse gases
Include
- water vapour
- methane
- nitrous oxide
- carbon dioxide

### Enhanced greenhouse effect
==Human activity== caused greenhouse gases to be released at a far **greater** rate than ==natural emissions==
