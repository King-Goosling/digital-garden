## Natural causes
### Variations in solar output
>[!info] Sunspots
>Sunspots are dark spots on the sun, and are the **cooler** regions of the sun. Areas around the sun spots radiate **more** solar energy to compensate for the cooler sunspots.
>
>==Therefore $\uparrow$ sunspots -> $\uparrow$ solar energy emitted -> $\uparrow$ temperature==

**Example**: Peak in solar spots in 2000 -> rise in global temp. in 2000

### Volcanic Eruptions
-> from [[Volcanoes]]

Release **large** volumes of ==water vapour==, ==carbon dioxide==, ==dust== and ==ash== (which can **reflect** shortwave radiation back into space)
-> $\downarrow$ shortwave radiation reach earth's surface
-> $\downarrow$ regional and global temperatures

**Example**: Mount Pinatubo in Philippines in 1991

>[!fail] Effect
> Volcanic dust and ash released caused global temp. to drop by ==**~0.5Â°C**==

>[!success] Limitations of effect
>Volcanic dust and ash **settled** after some time, bringing the global climate back to normal

## Anthropogenic factors
meaning that it is caused by human activity

### Deforestation
-> loss of forests due to clearance, for **materials** (such as wood and paper) and **land** (such as mining and building of infrastructure)

**Example**: ==South America== has dense forest -> cleared for developments like cattle ranching

#### Release of carbon dioxide
1. Act of **deforestation** -> carbon dioxide released

2. $\downarrow$ trees to photosynthesis and **absorb** carbon dioxide -> $\uparrow$ carbon dioxide in atmosphere

3. No **forest cover** -> $\uparrow$ **temperature** of soil ==(soil rich in carbon)== -> $\uparrow$ rate of **oxidisation** of carbon ==(carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide)== -> $\uparrow$ carbon dioxide

### Changing land use
$\uparrow$ population
$\uparrow$ demand for agriculture, industries and urban area

#### Reasons for demands
>[!summary]+ Agriculture
**Produce $\uparrow$crops and raise $\uparrow$livestock -> $\uparrow$food for $\uparrow$population**
>
>**Example**: Crops
>- ==Tractors== (used to make farming more efficient) run on fossil fuels -> carbon dioxide released
>- ==Inorganic fertilisers== can cause nitrous oxide to be released
>- ==Dead leaves== from farming $\uparrow$decompose (due to $\uparrow$moisture in soil) -> methane released
>
**Example**: Cattle farming
>- Cows ==fart== (contain methane) -> methane released

>[!summary]+ Industries
**Produce $\uparrow$goods and services to cater to $\uparrow$population**
>- $\uparrow$ manufacturing -> $\uparrow$ energy

>[!summary]+ Urban use
**$\uparrow$ Demand as urban area provides $\uparrow$ quality of life** 
>
>- $\uparrow$Transport + $\uparrow$energy for household activities (cooking, lighting, etc.)

$\uparrow$ land converted for agriculture, industries and urban use

==To meet energy demands for agriculture, industries and urban areas,==
$\uparrow$ fossil fuels burnt
$\uparrow$ carbon dioxide released (fossil fuels have high carbon content)
