## Economic
### Advantages
Include:
- [[#Employment opportunities]]
- [[#Growth in income]]
- [[#Devt of infrastructure and facilities]]
#### Employment opportunities
Growth in tourism $\rightarrow$ growth in jobs (related to tourism industry) like:
- travel agents, tour guides, hotel staff (directly related)
- taxi drivers (indirectly related)
>[!example] ==UNWTO=='s statistics in ==2011==: ==235 million== people employed in the tourism industry worldwide

$\uparrow$ number of tourism-related jobs
$\uparrow$ employment opportunities (in tourism industry)
$\uparrow$ dispoable income
$\uparrow$ money spent in the country
$\uparrow$ economy of country
#### Growth in income
Growth in tourism $\rightarrow$ growth in income

$\uparrow$ tourists
$\uparrow$ demand for service of locals,
which leads to [[#Employment opportunities]]
>[!example] Fishermen on Pamalican Island, Philippines
>Fishermen bring tourists out to sea for whale watching 🐳
>$\uparrow$ income of locals
>$\uparrow$ dispoable income
>$\uparrow$ money spent in the country
>$\uparrow$ economy of country

Tourists spend money in host countries
$\rightarrow$ tourism receipt (money received from tourist spending)
    If foreign service is provided
    $\rightarrow$ host country must give some of their profits to the other countries
$\uparrow$ economy of country and other countries
#### Devt of infrastructure and facilities
Recall [[Growth of global tourism#Investment in infrastructure and services]]
>[!example] Underground Rail system expanded during Beijing Olympics
>$\rightarrow$ locals and visitors still using them AFTER the games
>$\uparrow$ manpower and resources required to operate services (or during construction)
>$\uparrow$ employment of locals
>$\uparrow$ locals have income and dispoable income
>$\uparrow$ money spent in the country
>$\uparrow$ economy of country
### Disadvantages
Include:
- [[#Seasonal unemployment]]
- [[#Underuse of facilities]]
- [[#Shortage of services]]
#### Seasonal unemployment
Some tourists activities affected by climate/seasons
>[!example] Example: People working in ski resort in Swiss Alps will lose their job in summer
>When summer comes, there would be no more snow to ski on
>$\rightarrow$ tourists stop coming
>$\rightarrow$ people working in ski resort no longer have tourists to provide services to
>$\rightarrow$ workers cannot earn income from tourists
>$\rightarrow$ workers have to find other jobs, or remain unemployed
>$\rightarrow$ income of workers decrease, or no income at all
>$\rightarrow$ people have lesser disposable income or none at all
>$\downarrow$ money spent in the country
>$\downarrow$ country's economy
#### Underuse of facilities
Some facilities may be built for a specific event. When that event ends, the facilities will no longer have a purpose $\rightarrow$ underused
>[!example] Example: ==Beijing National Aquatic Centre, China== built and used for ==2008 Beijing Olympics==
>After Olympics have ended, tourists stop visiting the centre (centre becomes neglected)
>$\downarrow$ tourists visit the centre
>$\downarrow$ income garnered from tourists
>$\rightarrow$ insufficient money to maintain the park yearly
>$\rightarrow$ centre had to be repurposed as a water park in ==2010==
#### Shortage of services
Services as in
- water supplies
- electricity

To maintain facilities used by tourists, large amount of services have to be used, like
- water used to:
    - maintain swimming pools
    - water grass in gold course
- electricity used to:
    - power facilities

Since not insufficient supply, supplies of locals have to be diverted to tourists infrastructure
$\rightarrow$ locals have lesser supplies
$\rightarrow$ locals' QOL worsen
$\rightarrow$ locals get sick more often
$\rightarrow$ locals cannot report to work (since they are sick)
$\downarrow$ productivity of locals
$\downarrow$ income of locals
$\downarrow$ disposable income of locals
$\downarrow$ money spent in the country
$\downarrow$ economy of country
## Socio-cultural
### Advantages
#### Preservation of culture and local customs
refers to the protection of the way of life of people, including
- traditional beliefs
- religious practices
>[!example] Example: ==Historical Christ Church== in ==Malacca, Malaysia== restored and became a relic of Malaysia's ==colonial history==
>Because of preservation,
>$\rightarrow$ places are more attractive
>$\uparrow$ tourists come to the area
>$\rightarrow$ economic benefits in the country (compensate for the money spent in preservation and restoration)
>
>Locals know about their origins
>$\rightarrow$ build sense of belonging to their community - which is Malacca
### Disadvantages
Include:
- [[#Dilution of culture and local customs]]
- [[#Increased crime]]
#### Dilution of culture and local customs
Cultural identity and values can be lost
>[!example] Food outlets, travel agencies and souvenir shops become the ==main business== in ==Kathmandu, Nepal==
>$\rightarrow$ city becomes busy (no longer relaxing)
>$\rightarrow$ original relaxing atmosphere is lost
>$\rightarrow$ locals move away

Dancers may modify their 'rituals'
- pose for photographers
- duration shortened so tourists will not get bored
- repeated several times a day
$\rightarrow$ significance and authenticity of rituals and other cultural practices are reduced (due to greed of money)
#### Increased crime
$\rightarrow$ tourists carry valuable items with them
$\rightarrow$ people would want to steal them by pickpocketing and mugging
$\rightarrow$ a lot of crime in popular tourist areas

Due to increased crimes,
$\uparrow$ people less keen to visit (do not want to lsoe possessions and money)
$\downarrow$ tourism arrivals
$\downarrow$ revenue
$\downarrow$ country's economy

>[!example] Example: ==Louvre, a museum in Paris, France==, after staff refused to work with the problems caused by pickpockets
>$\rightarrow$ lesser attractions
>$\uparrow$ people less keen to visit
>$\downarrow$ tourism arrivals
>$\downarrow$ profit earned by tourists
>$\downarrow$ economy of country
## Environmental
### Advantages
#### Conservation of natural environments
Tourism funding + Revenue garnered from them (by national parks and diving sites)
- coral reefs
- rainforests
- mountainous areas
>[!example] Example: ==Sepilok Orang-utan Rehabilitation Centre== in ==Sabah, Malaysia==
>visitor fees used to pay the staff working there
>$\rightarrow$ staff continue to work there (due to pay)
>$\rightarrow$ staff continue to tend to injured Orang-utans
>$\uparrow$ survival of Orang-utans
>
>Since Orang-utans are critically endangered, visitor fees and funding might have saved them from extinction
>$\rightarrow$ natural environment saved
>$\rightarrow$ no further damage to environment
### Disadvantages
Include:
- [[#Increased congestion]]
- [[#Vandalism]]
- [[#Pollution and littering]]
- [[#Destruction of habitats]]
- [[#Increased carbon footprint]]
#### Increased congestion
$\uparrow$ tourists come to visit tourist attractions
$\rightarrow$ overcrowding in tourist attractions
$\rightarrow$ vehicular and pedestrian traffic
>[!example] Example: Many tourists fill the older walkways and narrow streets in Rome, Italy
>With so many pedestrians crowded in a small area,
>$\rightarrow$ noise pollution (due to vehicles and pedestrians)
>$\rightarrow$ QOL of people living there (since it's very noisy)
>$\rightarrow$ social unrest
>
>With so many vehicles in a small area
>$\rightarrow$ a lot of traffic jams
>$\rightarrow$ vehicles powered without moving much
>$\rightarrow$ air pollution
#### Vandalism
refers to the crime of intentionally damaging the property of other's.

In the case of tourists sites,
- cultural
- historical 
- natural
sites may be vandalised by tourists
>[!example] ==Thousands== of stones and bricks of the ==Great Wall of China== are covered with graffiti
>$\rightarrow$ walls become ugly
>$\rightarrow$ walls no longer beautify environment
>$\rightarrow$ can erode and damage faster in the long-term

Vandalise cultural artefacts
$\rightarrow$ cultural artefacts may become useless and lose its worth

$\rightarrow$ social unrest (esp. locals)
#### Pollution and littering
can lead to degradation of environment

E.g.: Irresponsible tourists on cruise ships dump plastic wastes overboard
$\rightarrow$ cause pollution in the sea
$\rightarrow$ sea contaminated + marine life may try to eat the rubbish in the sea
$\rightarrow$ loss of marine life + become contaminated

$\rightarrow$ humans eat contaminated seafood
$\rightarrow$ food poisoning
#### Destruction of habitats
$\rightarrow$ too many tourists visit scenic places
$\rightarrow$ habitats and wildlife can be destroyed

noise pollution esp. from [[#Increased congestion]]
$\rightarrow$ disturb wildlife
>[!example] Example: Egypt's Red Sea coast is a popular place for diving and snorkelling
>1. irresponsible tourists collect shells and corals as souvenirs
>2. hotels and restaurants nearby dump waste and sewage into the sea
>$\rightarrow$ damage in habitat of coral reefs and exotic fish
>$\rightarrow$ marine life is damaged and may even go extinct

#### Increased carbon footprint
amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by activities involving the use of fossil fuels like:
- transport
    - planes
    - tour buses
- electricity
    - hotels
>[!example] Example: Carbon footprint of ==one-way economy class flight== from ==Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia==, is ==30kg of $CO_2$/passenger==
>$\uparrow$ tourists travelling
>$\uparrow$ carbon footprint
>$\uparrow$ greenhouse gas emissions
>$\rightarrow$ [[Climate change#u Enhanced greenhouse effect u|enhanced greenhouse effect]]
>$\rightarrow$  global warming
