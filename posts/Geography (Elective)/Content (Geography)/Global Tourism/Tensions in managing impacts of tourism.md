## Tensions between ==tourists== and ==locals==
$\rightarrow$ needs of tourists ⚔️ needs of locals
>[!example] ==2.9 million visitors== visit ==Bali, Indonesia==, which has population of ==4.2 million people==
>caused problems such as
>- congestion in local transport services
>      - $\uparrow$ difficult for locals to do their daily activities
>- ==65%== of Bali's water supply consumed by tourists
>      - $\rightarrow$ water shortage in some areas
>      - dug wells are dry $\rightarrow$  poorer people have no way to obtain water (they rely on dug wells since they cannot afford to use water supply in city area)
> - tourists PDA
>      - tourists think that it's normal
>         - native custom
>      - locals in Bali object
>         - local custom + locals expect tourists to respect them

## Tensions between==tourists== and ==environment==
$\rightarrow$ needs of tourists ⚔️ need to conserve environment
>[!example] A lot of tourists visit ==Machu Picchu, Peru== due to rich history and breathtaking landscape (recall [[Differences in Tourist Destinations#Places of scenic beauty 🏞]] and [[Differences in Tourist Destinations#Places with rich culture]])
>- ==75,000 tourists== hike on Inca Trail ==every year==
>    - $\rightarrow$ wear and tear of trail due to erosion
>- average of ==3,300 visitors== visit it ==every day==
>    - $\rightarrow$ land and artefacts damaged due to sheer weight and combined footsteps of tourists
