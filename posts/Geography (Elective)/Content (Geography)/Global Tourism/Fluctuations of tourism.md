## Disasters
Similar to [[Natural Hazards]], they cause
- great damage to properties
- injuries / great loss of lives
>[!example] Example: Earthquake in ==Tohoku, Japan, 2011== caused the ==Fukushima nuclear disaster==
>Properties including Fukushima nuclear powerplant destroyed
>
>Earthquake caused a tsunami
>$\rightarrow$ flooded the Fukushima nuclear powerplant
>$\rightarrow$ nuclear disaster (radation leakage)
>$\rightarrow$ tourists discouraged from visiting (concerned about their safety) for months
>$\rightarrow$ tourists arrivals decreased by ==28%==
>$\downarrow$ revenue garnered from tourists
>$\downarrow$ country's economy
## Recessions
refers to period of general slowdown in economic activities
>[!example] Example: ==Global Financial Crisis== in ==2007== and ==2008==
>$\rightarrow$ world's largest financial firms went bankrupt
>$\rightarrow$ businesses lose money
>$\rightarrow$ businesses fire workers (to save money)/close down (due to bankruptcy)
>$\rightarrow$ people lose jobs
>$\rightarrow$ people lose income
>$\rightarrow$ people lesser/no disposing income
>$\rightarrow$ people cut on spending (esp. for leisure like travelling)
>$\downarrow$ people travel
>$\downarrow$ tourists worldwide
>$\downarrow$ country's economy
>BUT
>$\uparrow$ domestic tourism (cheaper and affordable since $\downarrow$ distance, $\downarrow$ travel fees)
>
>$\therefore$
>$\downarrow$ international tourism
>$\uparrow$ domestic tourism
>
>Recall [[Growth of global tourism#Disposable income]]

>$\rightarrow$ no commercial flights in Libya for months
>$\rightarrow$ drop in tourists arrivals
>$\rightarrow$ revenue garnered from tourists
>$\rightarrow$ country's economy reduced

>[!example] Example: SARS outbreak spread over ==6== months globally in ==2003==
>It killed ==>700== people and infected ==>8000== people in ==29== countries
>
>$\rightarrow$ respective govt. advised citizens not to travel to areas with SARS
