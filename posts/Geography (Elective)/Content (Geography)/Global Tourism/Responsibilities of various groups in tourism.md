## Local communities
have to
- conserve and protect tourist areas
- practise **community-based tourism**
   - tourism that has ==close contact with local community==
>[!success] Strengths
>>[!example] Candirejo Village, Central Java
>>Programmes are carried out, which include
>>- developing homestay accommodations 🏠
>>- organic farms 🧑‍🌾
>>- organise public transport
>>
>>They also train villagers to
>>- produce handicrafts
>>- provide catering
>>- work as tour guides
>
>  1. $\uparrow$ tourist-related jobs
>  $\uparrow$ ==employment and business opportunities for locals==
>  
>  2. $\rightarrow$ ==locals involved in decision-making==
>  $\rightarrow$ concerns and problems of locals addressed (they have more knowledge about which place is bustling with tourists and which place is not)

>[!fail] Limitations
>1. ==Difficult for local communities to get external funding==
>$\rightarrow$ funding
>$\rightarrow$ limitation on how many tourist-related jobs/businesses can be set up
>
>2. $\rightarrow$ takes a long time to train locals
>$\rightarrow$ still have ==shortage of skilled labour==
>$\rightarrow$ limitation on how many tourist-related jobs/businesses can be set up (some jobs/businesses require skill)

## Visitors
have to
- respect environment and local population (don't cause damage or offence)
>[!success] Strengths
>1. ==Preserve environment/attractions...==
>   a) ==...directly== (environment)
>>[!example] 2007 Tourism Sustainability Report
>encourage tourists to select their holiday destinations based on the conservation efforts of the place, including
>>- carbon footprint
>>- amount of water used
>>- amount of waste recycled
>>
>>$\rightarrow$ environment is conserved
>
>    b) ==...via providing funds== (environment and attractions)
>    $\rightarrow$ pay for goods and services in destination (e.g. souvenirs and entrance fees)
>    $\rightarrow$ locals have more money to spend on conserving the environment
>
>    c) ==...via raising awareness== (environment and attractions)
>    $\rightarrow$ visitors realise the value of conserving the environment/attraction (*'If I... , this beautiful place will be lost'*)
>    $\rightarrow$ share experience and knowledge with family and friends
>
>2. ==Provide income opportunities for locals==
>    $\uparrow$ demand for goods and services
>    $\uparrow$ tourist-related job opportunities (jobs that provide the goods and services)
>    $\rightarrow$ earn money from tourists (i.e. the consumers)

>[!fail] Limitations
>1. Environment may still be damaged
>$\rightarrow$ through [[Impacts of tourism#Vandalism]] and [[Impacts of tourism#Pollution and littering]]
>
>2. Dilute local culture and customs (recall [[Impacts of tourism#Dilution of culture and local customs]])

## Tour operators
$\rightarrow$ belongs to associations that are increasingly concerned with ==conserving and protecting environments visited by tourists== 
- they do so by operating in ==sustainable== way
- they are concerned because if ==landscape, biodiversity, culture deteriorate== in a place, $\downarrow$ tourists visit the place
>[!success] Strengths
>1. ==Preserve environment/attractions by...==
>   
>   a) ==...enforcing regulations on tour operators==
>>[!example] Phuket Alternative Tours (PAT)
>>Tour operators have to
>>- operate in environmentally-friendly way
>>- seek to enhance natural environment
>>- spread awareness about environmental conservation for visitors in Phuket
>
>   b) ==...providing feedback==
>   $\rightarrow$ tour guides notice some flaws and give feedback to tour operators
>   $\rightarrow$ local communities and planning authorities can see these feedback and improve tourism management
>
>3. ==Regulate tourists behaviour==
>$\rightarrow$ prevent tourists from
>    - [[Impacts of tourism#Pollution and littering]]
>       - $\downarrow$ damage of environment
>    - [[Impacts of tourism#Vandalism]]
>       - $\downarrow$ chances of social unrest
>    - wandering into restricted areas
>       - $\downarrow$ reduce disturbance and maintain peace
>       - $\downarrow$ prevent law and order problems

>[!fail] Limitations
>1. Tour operators still may not ==take the effort to preserve the environment==
>    $\rightarrow$ tour operators may be greedy for profits
>    $\rightarrow$ neglect the importance of preserving the environment (esp. when doing so will decrease their profits)

## Non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
are ==non-profit organisations== operating ==independently of govt.==
- they monitor tourist's impact on environment
>[!success] Strengths
>1. ==Facilitate communication between stakeholders==
>- NGOs are neutral parties
>- NGOs encourage locals to actively participate in managing impacts of tourism (and cooperate with planning authorities)
>
>2. ==Support stakeholders in managing impacts of tourism==
>support can be
>- additional manpower 💪
>- expertise 🤓
>- marketing campaigns 
>>[!example] The International Ecotourism Society (TIES)
>>- develops guidelines
>>- conduct training courses 🔨
>>- provide technical assistance 🏗️
>>- publish research papers (related to tourism and environment) 📜
>>
>>$\rightarrow$ this assistance can help stakeholders to better manage impacts of tourism
>>$\rightarrow$ impacts of tourism are better managed
>>

>[!fail] Limitations
>1. Difficulty in obtaining external funding
>$\rightarrow$ NGOs are non-profit organisations
>$\rightarrow$  rely on donations for money
>$\rightarrow$ may be hampered if there's not enough donations

## Planning authorities
$\rightarrow$ refers to government bodies
- influence future quality of environment
- determine
   - how many visitors a site can cope
   - allocate space for infrastructure
- consider [[#Local communities]] views
- enforce rules, regulations, values and principles
>[!success] Strengths
>1. ==Develop and maintain infrastructure and attractions==
>>[!example] ==Singapore Tourism Board== has implemented programmes to conserve ethnic districts of ==Chinatown==, ==Kampong Glam==, and ==Little India==
>>locals and visitors
>>$\rightarrow$ can better appreciate Singapore's heritage
>>$\rightarrow$ will protect these districts from being destroyed/damaged
>
>2. ==Draft laws and policies== to improve quality of tourist site
>
>   E.g.
>   develop laws that
>   - limit tourists numbers in that site
>       - $\rightarrow$ prevent [[Impacts of tourism#Increased congestion]]
>   - restrict people from vandalising
>       - $\rightarrow$  prevent [[Impacts of tourism#Vandalism]]
>   - restrict people from littering
>       - $\rightarrow$ prevent [[Impacts of tourism#Pollution and littering]]
> 
> 3. ==Work together with other government bodies to manage [[Impacts of tourism]]==
> $\uparrow$ resources to work with, esp. financially (can fund the various groups as aforementioned)

>[!fail] Limitations
>1. ==Difficult to plan for unforeseen factors==
>includes:
>    - extreme weather
>    - natural disasters
>    - general lack of interest from public
>
>2. ==Opposing stakeholders==
>Planning authorities' management can affect stakeholders' **way of life** (stakeholders think that there's **better alternative**)
>$\rightarrow$ oppose authorities
>$\rightarrow$ tourism management strategies have limited impact since:
>    - no cooperation from stakeholders
>    - stakeholders may retaliate and cause social unrest
