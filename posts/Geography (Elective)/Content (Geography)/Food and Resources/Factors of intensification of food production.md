## Physical
Includes:
- [[#Climate]]
    - [[#Temperature]]
    - [[#Rainfall]]
    - [[#Seasons]]
        - [[#Crops]]
        - [[#Meat Eggs Milk]]
- [[#Soils and drainage]]
    - [[#Soil fertility]]
    - [[#Soil drainage]]
- [[#Relief]]
### Climate
![[Weather vs Climate#^bd223d]]
It can affect
#### Temperature
affects
- rate of photosynthesis
- seed germination
for most plants so temp. below ==5Â°C== is unsuitable for plant growth in general
| Climate        | Crops                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Cooler climate | Pea, Broccoli, Strawberry |
| Warmer climate | Soya beans, Tomato        |

Diff plants, diff ideal temp.
#### Rainfall
is important for ==plant growth== so places with ==little rainfall== are usually unsuitable for growth of plants
| Rainfall                           | Crops |
| ---------------------------------- | ----- |
| More rainfall (**1500-2000mm/yr**) | Rice  |
| Less rainfall (**500-800mm/yr**)   | Corn  |
Diff plants, diff amount of rainfall for ideal growth
#### Seasons
##### Crops
can affect ==length of growing season==
>[!example] ==Tropical countries== can have greater food productions as compared to ==regular temperate countries==
>**Tropical countries** have 2-3 growing season
>**Regular temperate countries** have 1 growing season
>$\therefore$ **tropical countries** can have further intensified food production

However, ==greenhouses== can use to combat seasonal change by controlling
- temperature
- light
- irrigation
so that crops can be grown throughout the year no matter the climate
##### Meat/Eggs/Milk
Cattle and poultry can be kept in ==sheltered farms== for favourable environment for growth
**Extreme hot/cold temp**
$\rightarrow$ cattle and poultry becomes stressed
$\uparrow$ more likely to suffer from infections
$\downarrow$ less milk, eggs and meat produced (infected meat are unfit for consumption)
**High moisture**
$\uparrow$ more likely to suffer from fungal and parasitic diseasese
### Soils and drainage
#### Soil fertility
depends on availability of
- air
- water
- nutrients

Fertile soil are rich in:
- potassium ($K$)
- nitrogen ($N$)
- phosphorus ($P$)
*'Kay, No Problem'*
and found in:
- floodplains along river
- deltas at river mouth
- areas near volcanoes
>[!example] $\uparrow$ Very high production of ==rice== in ==Mekong Delta of Vietnam== due to beneficial features like
>- highly fertile soils
>- flat terrain
>- large water supply
#### Soil drainage
refers to ability of soil to retain / drain off water
| Type of soil                                          | Crops |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| ==Well-drained== **sandy** soil                       | Oats  |
| Soil with more **clay** with ==high water retention== | Rice  |
depends on [[#Relief]] and porosity (sand vs clay)
### Relief
When relief is steep, and when it is raining, topsoil
$\rightarrow$ becomes saturated with water more easily
$\rightarrow$ becomes more unstable
$\rightarrow$ is removed by rain
![[Pasted image 20220803200433.png|100]]

Furthermore,
$\uparrow$ altitude
$\downarrow$ temp.
(recall [[Altitude]])

Initially unsuitable slopes can be modified to create flat lands using ==terracing==

![[Pasted image 20220803201324.png|200]]
>[!example] ==Sapa in Vietnam== uses terracing

| Land           | Small (==1-3== hectares)                                | Large (==30 to thousands== of hectares)                                          |
| Labour         | Family members of farmer                                | Hired labour                                                                     |
| Capital        | - Simple farming tools - Seeds from previous harvest    | - Machinery - Tractors/Combined harvesters                                       |
| Crop yield     | $\downarrow$ Low                                                     | $\uparrow$ High                                                                             |
| Examples       | - In ==Sub-Saharan Africa== - Staple food like ==corn== | - In ==Europe, North and South America, Australia, Asia== - Crops like ==wheat== and ==tea== |
### Demand and capital
$\uparrow$ capital of consumer
$\rightarrow$ demand can be met

$\downarrow$ capital of consumer
$\rightarrow$ demand cannot be met

$\uparrow$ demand for food (changes with taste and preferences)
$\uparrow$ production of food
>[!example] ==China== used to be producer and exporter of ==corn== for ==livestock feed== in wealthier countries. Now, it's does the opposite.
>$\uparrow$ demand for meat in China
>$\uparrow$ demand for livestock feed in China
>$\uparrow$ production of corn in USA
### Agribusiness
refers to businesses/industries involved in food production including
- processing
- packaging
- distributing
- retailing
- investing in **research and development (R&D)** in producing crops with ==greater crop yields==

They can withstand negative impacts that would affect smaller-scale farmers as they have ==access to technology== like
- GMO crops
- advanced machinery
- better commerial networks

## Political
Includes:
- [[#Government policy national scale]]
    - [[#Agriculture policy]]
    - [[#Food policy]]
- [[#ASEAN regional scale]]
### Government policy **(national scale)**
#### Agriculture policy
$\rightarrow$ policies pertaining to ==domestic agriculture==
$\rightarrow$ decision on how ==money== and ==land== is used to intensify food production
>[!example] In ==India==, ==Punjab Agriculture Department (2012)== started an education programme for its ==wheat farmers==
>In this programme, farmers were taught about ==new technological advances== regarding farming
>- best seed varieties (i.e. high yield varieties (HYV))
>- pesticide treatment
>- irrigation methods
#### Food policy
$\rightarrow$ decision made by government on food
    - production
    - processing
    - distribution
    - purchase
    - packaging
$\rightarrow$ ensures ==food security== (via **stockpiling** and **diversifying of food supply**)

**Stockpiling**
store extra food (sourced from ==local farms== / imported from ==overseas==) in case of emergency

**Diversification of food supply**
$\uparrow$ ==more food suppliers== sourced from $\uparrow$ ==more countries== to buffer against food shortages and price fluctuations

>[!example] In the past, ==Singapore== bought **vegetables** mainly from ==Malaysia==. Now, a $\uparrow$ **larger portion** of **vegetables** are bought from ==China== and ==USA==

>[!example] ==Singapore govt== encouraged ==local companies== to **place contracts directly** with ==farmers== for **agreed amount and price** of food
>>[!example] ==NTUC== purchases **vegetables** through contracts with ==Indonesian farmers==
### ASEAN **(regional scale)**
>[!example] In ==October 2011==, ASEAN signed an agreement with ==China==, ==Japan==, and ==South Korea== to ensure **food security** for its members

## Technological
Includes:
- [[#Green Revolution]]
    - [[#High-yielding varieties HYV]]
    - [[#Fertilisers]]
    - [[#Pesticides and herbicides]]
    - [[#Irrigation]]
    - [[#Mechanisation]]
### Green Revolution
refers to **rapid increase in productivity** of agriculture through use of ==science and technology==
#### High-yielding varieties (HYV)
$\rightarrow$ are improved **strains of crops** (e.g. cereals like rice and wheat) that have $\uparrow$ **increased growth rate** by **selective cross-breeding**
>[!example] ==Wonder Rice== has growing season of ==100 days== as compared to conventional rice at ==120 days==
>$\uparrow$ yields per unit time
#### Fertilisers
$\rightarrow$ are added to soil to **provide nutrients** for plant growth

Fertilisers are added as nutrients in farmland naturally $\downarrow$ deplete (due to continuous use). This ensure that
$\rightarrow$ plants get sufficient nutrients
$\rightarrow$ plants can grow to their fullest
$\uparrow$ crop yield

#### Pesticides and herbicides
$\rightarrow$ are chemical substances to kill
    - insects and small animals (pesticides)
    - other plants that threaten crops like ==weed== (herbicides)

This ensures that
$\downarrow$ pest damage
$\rightarrow$ plants can grow without impediment
$\uparrow$ crop yield
>[!example] ==Malathion== is used a lot in ==1980s== to alleviate the ==fruit fly== problem in ==orchards== in ==California, USA==

#### Irrigation
$\rightarrow$ man-made method to supply water (and not by natural means like rain) to the crops to help their growth

By supplying water to dry lands (that are unsuitable for farming),
$\uparrow$ arable land for agriculture
$\uparrow$ amount of crops that can be grown
$\uparrow$ crop yield
>[!example] Irrigation is ultilised to make the ==Great Man-made River in Libya==
>The Great Man-made River supplies water to many farms in the ==Sahara desert==, which was initially too dry for agriculture (if it weren't for the river)

>[!example] Examples of irrigation methods
>**Flood irrigation**: Water is delivered to whole surface (e.g. rice fields)
>![[Pasted image 20220803215715.png|200]]
>**Centre-pivot irrigation**: ==Overhead rotating== sprinklers on ==wheeled towers== $\rightarrow$ can move automatically + being overhead allows water to be sprayed over a larger area
>![[Pasted image 20220803220003.png|200]]
#### Mechanisation
$\rightarrow$ refers to growing use of ==advanced machinery== to replace traditional labour

Advanced machinery helps to do farmer's manual labour automatically
+it is more efficient
($\uparrow$ more land can be tended to at $\downarrow$ labour)
$\downarrow$ time taken to prepare land, harvest crops, etc.
$\uparrow$ crop yield
>[!example] ==Combine harvesters== have $\uparrow$ increased crop yield as it is a **single machine** which can carry out **multiple agricultural tasks**
