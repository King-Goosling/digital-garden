## Health
Includes:
- [[#Ill-health]]
- [[#Malnutrition]]
- [[#Starvation]]
### Ill-health
People may fall sick and be afflicted by health conditions if they suffer from [[#Malnutrition]]
| Nutrient  | Source                                | Symptom |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Vitamin A | Eggs, cheese, meat                     | Visual impairment, blindness, iarrhoeal diseases and measles        |
| Calcium   | Diary products (e.g. milk and cheese) | Osteoporosis        |
| Vitamin D | Sufficient exposure to sunlight       | Osteoporosis        |
### Malnutrition
condition where body have ==insufficient/unbalanced== amount of nutrients to maintain
- healthy tissues
- organ functions
#### DCs
>[!example] ==Thousands== of elderly die ==annually== in ==USA== from lack of nutrients
>==Elderlies== are prone to malnutrition as they have difficulty digesting or chewing food
>
>People with ==eating disorders== are prone to malnutrition too
#### LDCs
>[!example] ==16%== of people living in LDCs suffer from malnutrition
>People living in LDCs are prone to malnutrition as they lack access to food
### Starvation
- extreme malnutrition/hunger from severe lack of food
    $\rightarrow$ body becomes skeletally thin ☠️
    $\rightarrow$ organs become permanently demaged
- occurs because of
>[!example] 98% of people facing starvation are from LDCs
>People from LDCs more prone to starvation due to
>- $\uparrow$ ==no. of people living in poverty==
>   - poor economy in LDCs
>- $\uparrow$ ==lack of resources to counter against effects of natural disasters==
>   - LDCs do not have access to many resources
>- $\uparrow$ ==unstable political situation (e.g. war)==
>   - LDCs are usually disordered due to corruption/poor law enforcement
## Economic
Includes:
- [[#Lower productivity]]
- [[#Lesser financial resources]]
- [[#Long-term debt]]
### Lower productivity
Productivity refers to rate of production of ==goods and services==
>[!example] Farmers in LDCs may be less ==innovative==, less ==experimental==, or unable to implement ==improvements==
When [[#Malnutrition]], it will result in [[#Ill-health]]
>$\rightarrow$ poor thinking
>$\downarrow$ productivity (farming remains conventional and ineffective)
#### Workers
$\rightarrow$ workers cannot turn up for work (due to ill-health)
$\downarrow$ working days
$\downarrow$ productivity
$\downarrow$ income
#### Students
$\rightarrow$ students cannot turn up for school (due to ill-health)
$\downarrow$ school days
$\downarrow$ loss of educational opportunities
$\downarrow$ earning power in the future
### Lesser financial resources
$\uparrow$ people falling sick
$\uparrow$ demand for healthcare services
$\uparrow$ costs spent on healthcare
#### LDCs
Since
$\uparrow$ costs spent on healthcare
$\downarrow$ financial resources left
$\downarrow$ finance can be spent on other areas like education, housing, transportation, etc. (which can bring economic benefit)
$\downarrow$ economy growth of a country slows down
### Long-term debt
Food and financial aid can be given to people and countries to help them cope with ==insufficient supply of food==
>[!example] Food aid from USA
>is mostly bought from suppliers and transported by ship to the LDCs
>$\rightarrow$ food aid is ==34%== more expensive than local purchases
>$\rightarrow$ LDCs have losses of around ==US$5-7billion==
>$\rightarrow$ Since LDCs cannot afford to repay their debt, their debt keeps accumulating
>$\rightarrow$ LDCs must keep paying their debts constantly
>$\downarrow$ finance can be spent on other areas like education, housing, transportation, etc. (which can bring economic benefit)
>$\downarrow$ economy growth of a country slows down
## Political
### Social unrest
includes violent behaviour and public protests
>[!example] ==Drought== in ==Russia== decreased ==wheat== production and increased price of wheat in ==Mozambique== by ==30%== in ==2010==
>$\rightarrow$ peaceful protests express unhappiness
>$\rightarrow$ protests turned violent
>$\rightarrow$ ==400== injured, at least ==10== dead
## Social
### Scavenging
$\rightarrow$ searching through things that other people throw away
>[!example] Poorest places in Manila, The Philippines
>People don't have money
>$\rightarrow$ they sift through rubbish for metal wastes
>$\rightarrow$ many poor families use the metals to make 'homes' near the landfill (for easy access)
>
>$\rightarrow$ no money to buy food
>$\rightarrow$ sift through rubbish for food to prevent ==starvation==
#### Health risks
1. High exposure to bacteria
2. Exposure to toxic chemicals (e.g. mecury, lead)
#### Social problems
1. Dangerous/Illegal situations while scavenging (e.g. trespassing private property)
2. Scavengers are perceived as nuisance to the public $\rightarrow$ scavengers are sometimes verbally/physically harassed
