## Economic
Includes:
- [[#Disposable income]]
- [[#Pricing]]
### Disposable income
refers to amount of income left after taxes have been paid
#### DCs
$\uparrow$ disposable income
$\uparrow$ purchasing power
$\rightarrow$ can buy more food and more variety
$\uparrow$ food consumption
>[!example] ==Taiwan=='s high economic growth from ==1960s to 1990s==
>$\uparrow$ income
>$\uparrow$ disposable income
>$\uparrow$ meat consumption (x4)
>$\downarrow$ cereal consumption ($\div$ 2)
(meat consumption generally associated with wealth and status)
#### LDCs
$\downarrow$ disposable income
$\downarrow$ purchasing power
$\rightarrow$ cannot buy a lot of food
$\downarrow$ food consumption

$\uparrow$ majority of diet comprises of cereal
### Pricing
>affects LDCs more than DCs

>[!example] Food price crisis from ==2006 to 2008==
>Prices of food rose significantly
>Price of rice ==doubled==
#### DCs
$\uparrow$ disposable income
$\uparrow$ purchasing power

So when $\uparrow$ price of food,
$\rightarrow$ people just opt for cheaper alternatives (wide array of food in DCs)
#### LDCs
$\downarrow$ disposable income
$\downarrow$ purchasing power

So when $\uparrow$ price of food,
$\rightarrow$ cannot afford to buy food (limited variety of food in LDCs)
$\rightarrow$ people enraged
$\rightarrow$ social unrest (people start to protest)
## Socio-cultural
Includes:
- [[#Food preference]]
    - [[#Religious beliefs]]
    - [[#Fast food]]
    - [[#Organic food]]
- [[#Population growth]]
### Food preference
>affects DCs more than LDCs (fast food and organic food)
#### Religious beliefs
$\rightarrow$ different food practices (e.g. restricted from eating a type of food)
$\rightarrow$ different food preferences
$\rightarrow$ multifarious food available (to cater to the needs of different religions)
#### Fast food
$\rightarrow$ lives of the adults in DCs are hectic and busy
$\rightarrow$ opt for fast food since fast food is quick (to eat)
$\uparrow$ fast food consumption

However,
$\uparrow$ adult literacy rate
$\rightarrow$ people in DCs are more educated
$\rightarrow$ know about the harmful effects of fast food
$\rightarrow$ eat fast food lesser (want to lead a healthier lifestyle)
$\downarrow$ fast food consumption
#### Organic food
refers to food grown without the use of artificial inputs (e.g. pesticides, chemical fertilisers, and growth hormones)

$\uparrow$ adult literacy rate
$\uparrow$ people in DCs are more educated
$\uparrow$ people concerned about risk of cancer from artifcial inputs
$\uparrow$ people opt for organic food
$\uparrow$ organic food consumption

$\uparrow$ income level
$\uparrow$ disposable income
$\uparrow$ purchasing power
$\uparrow$ more people can buy organic food (organic food are more expensive)
$\uparrow$ organic food consumption
### Population growth
#### DCs
$\downarrow$ low birth rate (less incentive)
$\downarrow$ population
$\downarrow$ food consumption
#### LDCs
$\uparrow$ high birth rate (need children to be successful and wealthier in the future $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ income for family)
$\uparrow$ population
$\uparrow$ food consumption
## Political
Includes:
- [[#Stability of food supply]]
    - [[#Ensuring stability]]
    - [[#Civil war]]
    - [[#Natural disasters]]
- [[#Food safety]]
### Stability of food supply
is when ==safe and nutritious== food is available to ==everyone at all times==

$\rightarrow$ transportation disruption (unsafe)
$\rightarrow$ access to food suppliers cut off
$\rightarrow$ unstable food supply
$\therefore$ $\downarrow$ food consumption
>affects LDCs more than DCs (ensurance of stability)
#### Ensuring stability
1. $\uparrow$ food production
    - difficult for LDCs as technology is required + high costs
2. $\uparrow$ amount of imported food
>[!example] $>$ ==90%== of ==Singapore=='s food supply is from food imports
>Singapore is DC
>$\rightarrow$ more money
>$\rightarrow$ more food can be imported

>[!example] ==Jamaica== couldn't import food after a ==hurricane== disaster in ==2004== as it was too expensive
Difficult for LDCs to increase food imports as more money is required to do so
#### Civil war
>[!example] Food stocks in Libya rapidly depleted during ==Libya Civil War== in ==2011==
>
#### Natural disasters
>[!example] ==Severe drought== in ==Zimbabwe== destroyed most of its ==corn== harvest in ==2008== (lack of ==rainfall==)
>
### Food safety
refers to system that
1. provides guidelines
    - set food safety standards
2. ensure proper handling, preparation and storage of food
to prevent foodborne diseases

>affects LDCs more than DCs (ensurance of stability)
#### DCs
If there's contaminated food,
$\rightarrow$ track down contaminated food
$\rightarrow$ remove them from shelves (for sale) / restrict import
$\downarrow$ consumption of food
#### LDCs
$\rightarrow$ poor (tele)communication (lack of technology)
$\rightarrow$ misinformed / not informed
$\rightarrow$ products are shipped and bought anyways

$\rightarrow$ prone to mishandling + not follow standards
$\rightarrow$ products are shipped and bought anyways

$\rightarrow$ less food choices in LDCs
$\rightarrow$ cannot afford to remove from shelves / restrict import
$\rightarrow$ products are shipped and bought anyways
