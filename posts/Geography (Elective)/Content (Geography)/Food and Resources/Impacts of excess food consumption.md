## Health
### Obesity and illnesses
$\rightarrow$ condition of being ==overweight== due to overconsumption of nutrients which would eventually be stored as ==fats==

### Prolonged accumulation of body fats
- high blood pressure
- diabetes
- obesity

### Exessive consumption of some minerals
- kidney failure
- liver diseases
- hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure)
#### DCs
>[!example] Obesity rates are higher in ==DCs (e.g. USA)== than that in ==LDCs (e.g. India)==
>![[Variation in food consumption patterns (DCs vs LDCs)#Purchasing power]]
>$\uparrow$ consumption of sweetened beverages, potato chips and fast food (more purchasing power to buy more of them)
>$\uparrow$ obesity rates in ==USA== grow from ==14.5%== to ==30.9%==
#### LDCs
>[!example] In growing ==LDCs== like ==Mexico==, obseity rates have exceeded average obesity rates of ==DCs==
## Economic
Includes:
- [[#Lower productivity]]
- [[#Lesser financial resources]]
### Lower productivity
>[!example] Employees with BMI over ==40== are ==x2== as likely to fall sick / be injured while working in ==USA==
>#### Company
>$\uparrow$ compensation claims for wages and medical bills for those employees
>$\downarrow$ profits reaped by companies
>$\downarrow$ economy of companies
>
>#### Individual

### Lesser financial resources
![[Impacts of inadequate food consumption#Lesser financial resources]]
## Social
Includes:
- [[#Food wastage]]
- [[#Dieting]]
### Food wastage
Excess food $\rightarrow$ waste food
>[!example] Food wastage by consumers in DCs (==230 million tonnes each year==) = Total amount of food available in ==Sub-Saharan Africa== (for ==local== consumption)
#### Negative
1. Since food is being wasted
    $\uparrow$ waste must be disposed of
    $\uparrow$ more landfills have to be made
    $\downarrow$ land available to other purposes (housing, factories, etc.)
2. Since food is being wasted
    $\rightarrow$ resources used to produce the food is wasted too (e.g. water)
### Dieting
$\rightarrow$ practice of regulating food consumption to ==maintain ideal body weight==
#### Positive
$\uparrow$ employment opportunities + economy
>[!example] Weight loss industry in USA is priced at US$20 billion
>As more people become more aware and concerned about eating healthy (mostly DCs), they signed up for weight loss courses/classes/etc to lose weight.
>
>##### Employment opportunities
>$\uparrow$ demand for weight loss services
>$\uparrow$ growth of weight loss industry
>$\uparrow$ people required to run the bigger weight loss industry
>$\uparrow$ employment opportunities
>
>##### Economy of industry
>$\uparrow$ customers paying these industries for their services
>$\uparrow$ profit of weight loss industry
>$\uparrow$ economy of industry
#### Negative
Inappropriate dieting $\rightarrow$ health and mental health conditions (e.g. depression)
