## Effects of irrigation
Include:
- [[#Waterlogging]]
- [[#Salinisation]]
### Waterlogging
- caused by **extensive irrigation**
- when too much water seeps into the soil and cause soil to be **over-saturated**
    $\rightarrow$ roots deprived of air and nutrients
    $\rightarrow$ crops die
### Salinisation
>[!example] Salinisation in ==Murray-Darling Basin== in ==Australia==
>![[Pasted image 20220811220513.png|350]]
>Normally, excess water will dissolve the salt and bring it into the Murray river
>![[Pasted image 20220811220614.png|350]]
>Due to irrigation
>1. there's ==no proper drainage of excess water==, and groundwater may reach upper soil layers
>     -  $\rightarrow$ dissolved salts are brought up from ground
>     -  $\rightarrow$ crops will die since they don't grow well in saline soil (i.e. soil with $\uparrow$ conc. of salt)
>2. water added to the soil (for irrigation) ==evaporates directly== from moist soil
>     - $\rightarrow$ salt is left behind on the soil after water has evaporated
## Effects of chemicals
Include:
- [[#Eutrophication]]
    - [[#Measures to reverse eutrophication]]
### Eutrophication
- a bloom of algae due to **excess nutrients** in water

Overuse of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides
$\uparrow$ conc. of chemical in soil
$\rightarrow$ chemicals seep into groundwater and **contaminates** it
$\rightarrow$ chemicals washed into rivers due to **surface runoff**
>**Surface runoff**: flow of water occurring on the ground surface

$\rightarrow$ chemicals serve as nutrients for algaes to grow (on the surface of water)
$\rightarrow$ algae blocks sunlight from aquatic plants
$\rightarrow$ aquatic plants respire instead of photosynthesising in absence of sunlight
$\downarrow$ oxygen in water
$\rightarrow$ lack of oxygen in water
$\rightarrow$ death of aquatic life (plants and animals alike)
$\rightarrow$ aquatic plants decompose upon death
$\downarrow$ oxygen in water depleted further
#### Measures to reverse eutrophication
1. Implement control measure to prevent nutrients from teaching water bodies 🚧
2. Raise awareness through campaigns 📣
3. Cooperation between stakeholders (govt, NGOs and community) to monitor pollution level in environment 🤝
