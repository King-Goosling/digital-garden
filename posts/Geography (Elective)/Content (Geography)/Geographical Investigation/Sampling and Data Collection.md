# Sampling and Data Collection
## Sampling
|               | Random sampling | Systematic sampling | Stratified sampling |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Description   | Use random number generator (e.g. number 8 $\rightarrow$ next 8th person will be selected)                | Every $n$th person selected / Alternate between female and male                    |1. Divide **population** into subgroups<br>2. Calculate how many ppl should be sampled (to balance proportions of all subgroups)<br>3. Use ==random sampling== or ==systematic sampling== to select sample from each subgroup                     |
| Advantages    |- Everyone has **equal chance** of being selected<br>- No human bias (of interviewer selecting interviewee)<br>- Quick and simple to carry out (If using random number generator)                 |- **Reduces chances of under-representation** as interviewees selected are more spread out throughout population<br>- No human bias (of interviewer selecting interviewee)<br>- Quicker and simpler than ==random sampling== (no need to use random number generator)                     |- **Fair representation** of diff. subgroups                     |
| Disadvantages |- May be **unrepresentative** since it's entirely random (e.g. 15th, 18th, 27th persons turn out to be all men)<br>- May be **unrepresentative** due to distribution of respondents (e.g. many tour groups from one country visit the area)<br>- May take a **long time** (if using random number table)                |- May have an **unrepresentative** sample by chance (e.g. number 10 $\rightarrow$ every 10th person turns out to be female)                     |- **Time-consuming**                     |

### Questionnaire
>[!success] Advantages
>- Data will be **up-to-date** (unlike information found online which may be outdated)
>- Can be done **easily** and **quickly** (via technology like ==QR code== + it ==does not have more than 10 questions==)
>     $\uparrow$ people more willing to do the survey
>     $\uparrow$ **sample size**
>     AND
>     $\downarrow$ time spent
>     $\uparrow$ time to survey other people
>     $\uparrow$ **sample size**
>- ==Closed questions== help the interviewee to answer the question so they won't be stuck (due to the options given)
>- **Variety of questions** like
>     - closed question
>     - open-ended question
>     - ranking items question (rank according to liking, importance, etc.)
>     - Likert scale question (from 1 to 5, from worst to best)
>     
>     $\uparrow$ **variety of data**

>[!fail] Disadvantages
>- Interviewee **may not be able to think up of an answer** in ==open-ended questions== (esp. when their language is poor)
>     $\downarrow$ data collected from that person will be useless (since it's missing one answer)
>     $\downarrow$ **sample size**
>     AND
>     $\uparrow$ time wasted
>     $\downarrow$ time to survey other people
>     $\downarrow$ **sample size**
>- **Tiring** for interviewer as they have to read out the questions a lot of times to a lot of interviewees (if survey is ==not online==)

### Pilot Survey
Test [[#Questionnaire]]
- If questions unclear, biased, sensitive, etc.,
    $\rightarrow$ change and improve the questions
### Interview
Honestly dk why does this exist lol
### Land Use Survey
![[Pasted image 20220817211415.png]]
Best to use ==shading== along with a ==legend== to describe the **category** of land use (e.g. shops, services, f&b, etc.)
### Pedestrian Count
Ensure that
- timing is **fixed** at e.g. 10 minutes using ==stopwatch==
- count is **accurate** (use ==tally counter==)
- count is carried out at **same time** at e.g. 11am for both days (for fair comparison)
- **multiple people** are counting ($\downarrow$ human error)
- **multiple readings** are taken $\rightarrow$ find average (reduce human error)
- count is carried out for **multiple days** ($\uparrow$ sample size $\rightarrow$ conclusive evidence)
### Bipolar Survey
>[!success] Advantages
>1. **Easy** to collate results (==add positive and negative scores== to evaluate impacts of tourism)

>[!fail] Disadvantages
>1. This survey is based on **perception**
>     $\rightarrow$ **biasness**
>     $\rightarrow$ may result in **inaccurate** and **unreliable** result
>2. **Difficult** to derive to definitive conclusion if too many people choose ==neutral response== (neutral response is ==meaningless== and ==useless== data)
#### Recording sheet

#### Reference sheet
![[Pasted image 20220817221852.png|400]]
#### Bipolar graphs
Positive score: points $\times$ no. of responses
Negative score: points $\times$ no. of responses
![[Pasted image 20220817221038.png|400]]
E.g. Litter
Little litter: $2 \times 2+2 \times 1 = 6$
Much litter: $1 \times (-1) + 1 \times (-2) = -3$
