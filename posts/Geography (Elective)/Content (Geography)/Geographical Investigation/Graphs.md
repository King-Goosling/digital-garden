# Graphs
$x$-axis: Independent variable
$y$-axis: Dependent variable

## STAPLE framework
S: Symbol (%, mm, etc.)
T: Title (must be specific)
A: Axes ($x$-axis and $y$-axis)
P: Plot (the points and the graph)
L: Legend (if necessary) (Label in terms of **colour**)
E: (Nothing lmao)

## Purposes of graphs
| Graphs         | Purpose                                                                     | Consists of                                            | Note |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Line graphs    | Show relationship between two variables                                     | ==simple line graphs== and ==comparative line graphs== |    -  |
| Bar graphs     | Show categorical data like countries (in columns)                                          | ==simple bar graphs== and ==comparative bar graphs==   |  -    |
| Pie charts     | -                                                                           | -                                                      |-      |
| Scatter graphs | Show relationship between two variables                                     |-                                                        |There's no correlation only when **ALL** of the points don't show a pattern. If not, circle the anomalies and find the pattern.      |
| Climographs    | Show variations in mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation |        -                                                |   -   |
| Histograms     | Show quantitative data like age (in columns)                                                                            |     -                                                   |  Basically bar graph but bars are sticked together    |
