# Taking measurements
## Anemometer (wind speed)

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemometer

1. Stand up in open area where ==wind flows freely==
2. Hold it above your ==head== and ==away== from you
>Ensure no obstruction of wind to cause underestimation of reading
3. Read off display on amenometer

## Wind vane (wind direction)

1. Stand up in open area where ==wind flows freely==
2. Hold it above your ==head== and ==away== from you
>Ensure no obstruction of wind to cause underestimation of reading
3. Using a compass, ensure direction mark of wind vane is ==pointing correctly== (N of compass must point at same direction as N of direction mark)
4. Record direction of wind vane

==Can be represented in...==
### Wind rose (represents wind direction)

>[!info] Note
>- Not necessary to draw that many boxes, just draw as many as the amount of data you collected
>- Hexagon in the middle can be represented as circle

Numbers in boxes $\rightarrow$ Date of the month

Placement of number in boxes $\rightarrow$ Wind direction on corresponding day (categorised in 8 directions of compass)

Number in circle(/hexagon) $\rightarrow$ Number of calm days

Most amount of data in one direction $\rightarrow$ Corresponding direction is direction of prevailing wind

## Barometer (pressure)

Source: https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/barometer

1. Move ==movable pointer== to current pressure (before stepping into testing environment)
2. If move ==clockwise== -> increase in pressure, if move ==anti-clockwise== -> decrease in pressure
3. Ensure it is not placed under ==direct sunlight==
>Prevent heating up of metal cell -> Prevent expansion of metal cell -> Prevent false readings
4. Ensure it is not placed in ==exposed== places (e.g. near door)
>Pressure varies too much -> very hard to obtain fixed reading + inaccurate reading

## Analogue and digital thermometer (temperature)
Just read

## Maximum and Minimum Thermometer (max. and min. temp.)

1. Place in ==Stevenson screen==, ==**1.5m**== above ground and away from ==sunlight==
>**1.5m above ground**: Ground emits heat as longwave radiation
>**Away from direct sunlight**: Heat energy from sun
>$\rightarrow$ Prevent overestimation of max. temp
2. Read temperatures at the ==bottom of the metal indexes==

>[!info] Diurnal temp.
>Measure for the whole day and obtain diurnal temp. by finding diff. of max. and min. temp.

## Sling psychrometer (relative humidity)

Source: https://www.instrumentchoice.com.au/news/how-does-a-sling-psychrometer-work

1. Dip wick of wet bulb thermometer with ==water==
2. Swing ==far away== from body...
>Prevent sling psychrometer from taking in body heat -> prevent overestimation in rate of evaporation -> prevent underestimation in relative humidity
3. ...at **steady** and **constant** pace of ==**~2s/rotation**==
>Ensure constant rate of evaporation -> $\downarrow$ effect of other variables (on relative humidity) -> relative humidity derived will be more accurate
4. After **==1min==**, record down temp. of dry and wet bulb thermometer
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until same results are recorded **consistently**
>Reduce human error -> $\uparrow$ reliable
6. Calculate ==wet bulb depression== by finding diff. of dry and wet bulb temp.s
7. Use wet bulb depression and dry bulb temp. to convert to relative humidity using ==relative humidity conversion table==

## Rain gauge (precipitation)

1. Place rain gauge in an **open** area, away from ==trees and buildings==...
>- Prevent interception of rain to the mouth of rain gauge -> prevent underestimation
>- Prevent excessive water from streaming into the rain gauge -> prevent overestimation
2. ...with protection against the ==wind==...
>Prevent wind from blowing rainwater past rain guauge -> prevent underestimation
3. ...burying it with ==**30cm**== of it protruding above ground
>Prevent toppling -> loss of data
>and yet prevent backsplashing of water into and out of rain gauge -> inaccurate
4. ==Record time== of the events of rainfall, indicating the start and end time
5. Pour the rainwater in the rain gauge into a ==measuring cyclinder==, reading and recording the water level at eye level
>Prevent parallax error -> misreading of data
