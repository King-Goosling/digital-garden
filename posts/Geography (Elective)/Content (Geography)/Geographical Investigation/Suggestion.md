# Suggestion
## Hypothesis
- Must state ==relationship==; **specify** in what way variable A affects variable B
- ==Independent== and ==dependent== variables must be **correct**

### Evaluate the hypotheses
| Hypothesis                                             | Clear relationship stated? | Correct independent and dependent variables? | Overall |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Temperature is affected by wind                        |  $\times$                         |    $\checkmark$                                         |  $\times$       |
| The higher the temperature, the greater the wind speed |          $\checkmark$                 |    $\times$                                         |  $\times$       |
| The greater the wind speed, the lower the temperature  |           $\checkmark$                |          $\checkmark$                                   |   $\checkmark$      |
