## Massive destruction
During volcanic eruptions, **low-silica lava** and **hot ash & gases** are released, and **volcanic bombs**, **landslides** and **lahars** can occur

### Low-silica lava
==Pyroclasts== (rocks/mineral fragment expelled aerially from vent) mix with ==super-heated gases== -> ==pyroclastic flow== (speeds of up to **==200m/s==**)

- Moves **rapidly** and flows over **long** distances at speeds of ==**200m/s**==-> causes damage to larger areas -> more loss of lives and destruction of properties
- **High** temperatures of ==**500°C**== to ==**1,400°C**== -> burns the area it flows through 
	- (including ==forests==) -> carbon dioxide released -> suffocation / damage of lungs when inhaled
	- (including ==properties==) -> destruction of properties
	- (including ==people==) -> loss of lives

### Hot ash & gases
- Can cause serious injury / death when ==inhaled==

### Volcanic bombs
- Can ==fall== in areas near the volcano -> ==destruction== of properties
- Can be as ==big== as a *car* -> ==bigger destruction== of properties

#### Landslides
>[!info]
>Due to **structural collapse** of volcanic cone during volcanic eruption

- Can ==obstruct== **rivers** -> cause **floods** -> block **roads** + bury **villages** and **farmlands** ^c4a10b
	- -> ==destruction of properties==
	- -> no route for escape -> ==loss of lives==

>[!summary] Example: Eruption of ==Nevado del Ruiz== in Andes Mountain
in ==1985== killed ==tens of thousands== of people due to:
>
> ### Lahars (similar to landslides)
>- ==Pyroclastic flow== mix with ==water== (from lakes or melted ice) -> fast flowing mudflows known as ==lahars== (speeds of up to 40m/s)
>![[Risks and Benefits of living near volcanic areas#^c4a10b]]

## Pollution
- Ash particles ejected during volcanic eruption -> **settle** on the ground (eventually) -> ==block== sunlight + ==suffocate== crops + cause ==severe respiratory problems== for people and animals

>[!Summary] Example: Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland in **2010**
>- **Abrasive glass, sand and rock** released -> pose danger to aircraft engines -> air space closed -> delays for ==**>1mil.**== passengers daily -> airline industry experience loss of almost ==**$2bil. USD**== 
>
>- Fine ash particles of ==**<1μm**== can be carried by wind over ==**thousands of kilometres**== -> ==disrupt air space== (due to lack of **sight** + **harmful** particles in the air)

## Fertile Soil
**Lava and ash** from volcanic eruptions -> break down to form fertile **volcanic soils** (very favourable to agriculture)

>[!summary] Example: ==Java and Bali in Indonesia== cultivate crops such as ==tea, coffee and rice== well
>thanks to the abundance of volcanic soils there
>
>- more crops to sell -> farmers earn more money -> country benefits economically 

## Precious stones and minerals
can only be extracted from volcanic areas after **millions** of years, after **upper layers of volcanic rocks** have eroded.

>[!summary] Example: Volcanic rocks at ==Kimberly in South Africa== are one of the world's most richest sources of ==diamond== 
>which is useful as industrial tools, in scientific research, and jewellery.
>
>- Since rare and useful -> expensive -> miners earn more money -> country benefits economically

## Tourism
Volcanic areas offer tourists a place to **hike** / **camp** / a **scenery** to enjoy / **rich history** for them to learn about.

>[!summary] Example: ==Ruins of Pompeii, Italy== attracted ==3mil.== people every ==year==
>
>- Tour guides
>     - guide tourists & teach tourists the history
>- Hotels
>     - place for tourists to stay
>- Restaurants
>     - place for tourists to eat
>
>They all gained money from the tourists in exchange of their services -> country benefits economically

>[!danger] Pompeii VS Pompei
>Pompeii: The ancient town
>Pompei: A nearby modern town

## Geothermal energy
**Groundwater** comes into contact with **hot rocks** beneath surface -> **heats** up -> erupts as **hot water / steam**, which can be harnessed to drive **turbines** -> produce **electricity**

>[!summary] Example: In ==Iceland, **>70%**== of homes are heated by volcanic steam
>Due to large no. of volcanoes there
>
>- Government don't have to spend more money on other powerplants -> save money for other uses
