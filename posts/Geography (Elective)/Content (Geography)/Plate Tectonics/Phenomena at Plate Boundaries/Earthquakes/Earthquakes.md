## Formation of Earthquakes

When plates converge/diverge/slide past each other at convergent/divergent/transform plate boundaries
- **Pressure** builds up slowly
- Rocks can **no longer withstand** increasing **stress** -> **Slip** many metres
- Energy stored suddenly **released** at ==focus==, in form of ==seismic waves==
- Earth's surface **vibrate** due to ==seismic waves==, starting at the ==epicentre== -> ==Earthquake==

>[!info] Aftershocks
>- caused by ==stress in ground== after earthquakes
>- some occur **several months** after initial earthquake
>- some being **nearly as powerful** as initial earthquake


## Types of Earthquakes
Consist of **Deep-focus Earthquakes** and **Shallow-focus Earthquakes**

| Type of earthquake | Deep-focus earthquake                                                                                                                                                                                         | Shallow-focus earthquake        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Location of focus  | **70km** to **700km** below earth's surface                                                                                                                                                                   | **Upper 70km** of earth's crust |
| Impact on land     | **Smaller** impact | **Greater** impact              |
| Reason for the above              | **longer distance** from focus to earth's surface<br>-> seismic waves take **longer time** to reach surface<br>-> **most** of seismic waves' energy **lost**<br>-> **==smaller impact on land==**     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 **shorter** distance from focus to earth's surface<br>-> seismis waves reach surface **more quickly**<br>-> **little** energy of seismic waves is **lost**<br>-> ==**greater impact on land**==                               |

## Extent of Damage

Source: Made in https://webwhiteboard.com/

1. 'McNitude' (Magnitude)
    - 'Strength' of earthquake
2. Population density
    - Urban area has greater population density than rural areas
    -> More damage and casualties in urban areas
3. Level of preparedness
    - Include having evacuation plans, trained rescue workers, emergency drills
    -> People know what to do and be safe during an earthquake
    -> Lesser damage and casualties
4. Distance from epicentre
    - Seismic waves are stronger the nearer you are to epicentre
    -> Affects ==magnitude== of earthquake
5. Time of occurance
    - Where are people? What are they doing?
    -> At night, people are sleeping
    -> More people trapped in their houses
    -> More casualties
6. Type of soil
    - Prone to liquefaction
