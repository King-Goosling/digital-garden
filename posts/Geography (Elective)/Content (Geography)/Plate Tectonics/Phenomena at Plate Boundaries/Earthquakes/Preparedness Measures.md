## Monitoring and warning systems
**monitor** Earthquakes and Tsunamis and **predict** them, and **warn** the public if necessary

**Example**: ==Hawaii, USA== has a network of
- pressure sensors
- seismographs
- deep ocean tsunami detectors

>[!success] Successes
>- Detect the tsunami earlier -> increase chances of survival -> ==lesser loss of lives==

>[!fail] Limitations
>- ==Expensive== to obtain, install and use ==(problem for LDCs)==
>- Prone to give ==false alarms== when waves are high
>- Tsunami hits affected areas in a short time after the warnings have been disseminated -> little time for evacuation -> still result in ==loss of lives== ==(defeats purpose)==

## Infrastructure development
to **withstand vibrations** of earthquakes using **advanced engineering**

**Example**: ==Tapei 101== in ==Taiwan==

>[!success] Successes
>- Built with **steel** and **reinforced concrete** -> ==withstand earthquakes better== than >brittle materials (e.g. non-reinforced concrete)
>
>- **Damping devices** ==prevent swaying too much and collapsing==, by acting as
>	- **Shock absorber** for some of seismic energy
>	- **Counterweights** (move in opposite direction of motion of earthquake)
>
>- **Foundation** reinforced by **heavy metal bars** (heavy base -> less likely to collapse)

>[!fail] Limitations
>- ==Expensive== for
>	- **Construction** and **maintenance**
>	- **Convert** buildings to be earthquake-proof
>
>==(problem for LDCs)==

## Land use regulations
are set of **rules** implemented to **restrict developments** in certain areas

**Example**: ==California, USA==

>[!success] Successes
>- No new building developments are to be built near **faultlines** ==(where earthquakes occur)== or areas **prone to liquefaction** ==(which is the loss of stability of the ground during an event of an earthquake)==-> no destruction of properties -> no loss of lives from destruction

>[!fail] Limitations
>- Areas may already be **built up / privately owned**
>	- Government need to **compensate** residents / **buy** lands -> ==expensive== (problem for LDCs)
>	- Some owners **reluctant** to move (believing that no hazards will happen)

## Emergency drills
**Educate** people on what to do during an event of an earthquake/tsunami

**Example**: Every year since ==**1960**==, ==Japan== conducts emergency drills on ==**1 September**== to commemorate ==Disaster Prevention Day==

**Elaboration**: Emergency drills include
- Escaping to higher ground during a tsunami
- Escaping to a more open area during an earthquake

>[!success] Successes
>- People **know** what to do during an earthquake/tsunami -> **reduce** panic -> ==increase chances of survival==

>[!fail] Limitations
>- There is **no time** to evacuate often -> ==loss of lives== (defeats purpose)
