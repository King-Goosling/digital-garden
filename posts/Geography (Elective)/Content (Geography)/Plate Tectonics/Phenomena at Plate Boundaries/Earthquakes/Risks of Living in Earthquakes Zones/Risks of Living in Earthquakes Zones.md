# Risks of Living in Earthquakes Zones
## Tsunamis
Formation of [[Tsunamis]]

## Disruption of Services
...such as supply of **electricity, gas and water** and **communication services** (e.g. television broadcasts and telephone connections), and can affect a **large area**. ==Vibrations== in the ground can **break cables** and cause ==fires==.

## Landslides
...are rapid **downslope** movements of **soil, rocks and vegetation debris**, ==several metres== to ==several kilometres== in length and width.

Shaking of ground (during earthquake) can **weaken** slopes of hills and mountains. **Unstable** slopes can **give way** and cause ==**landslides.**==

## Destruction of Properties
As a result, people who lost their homes have to reside in temporary shelters while their homes are being rebuilt.

## Destruction of Infrastructure
...such as roads and bridges. Since it is **unsafe** to use damaged roads, **transportation** is disrupted (**lesser accessibility** to food, rescue, etc.)

## Loss of lives
Other factors often cause ==**loss of lives.**==
