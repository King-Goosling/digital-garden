1. **Seismic waves** from **underwater earthquakes** **displaces** mass of water
2. Creating waves
	- less than ==1m== tall
	- with **large** wavelengths of ==150m==
	- travelling at **fast** speeds of ==800km/h==
	- that pass by **undetected**
3. These waves travel towards coast -> reach **shallow waters** -> **more contact** with ground -> experience **greater friction**
4. This **friction** causes waves to
	- increase in height to ==15m== to ==30m==
	- - slow down to speeds of ==30km/h== to ==50km/h==
