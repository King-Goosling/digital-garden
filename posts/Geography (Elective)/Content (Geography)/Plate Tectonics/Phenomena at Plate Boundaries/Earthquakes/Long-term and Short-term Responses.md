## Short-term
### Search and rescue
People **trapped** under collapsed buildings can be quickly **located** and **freed**

**Example**: Earthquake in ==Tohoku, Japan== in ==**2011**==

>[!success] Successes
>**Example**: ==Sniffer dogs== and ==heat sensors== deployed -> many trapped survivors rescued
>- **Some** survivors are found after being trapped for weeks without **food** -> longer time to search -> more lives saved

>[!fail] Limitations
>**Example**: Rescue workers only have ==**3 days**== to search through ==**2 towns**== after earthquake
>- **Most** survivors cannot survive after ==**3 days**== without **food and water** -> limited time for rescue workers to search for survivors -> lesser lives can be saved

>[!caution] Notice
>Mostly applies to DCs since **technology** is utilised

### Emergency, food and medical supplies
**Treat** the injured + Provide **clean drinking water** -> Prevent **dehydration** (due to [[Risks of Living in Earthquakes Zones#u Disruption of Services u|disruption of services]]]) + Prevent **spread of diseases**

>[!success] Successes
>**Example**: After earthquake in ==Afyon, Turkey== in ==**2002**==, ==Turkish Red Cresent Society==
>- delivered ==**tens of thousands**== of tents and blankets, and ==**thousands**== of heaters --> with such quick aid, survivors can continue with their lives as fast as possible -> ==survivors less affected by disaster==

>[!fail] Limitations
>**Example**: After earthquake in ==Haiti== in ==**2010**==
>- lack of supplies (even though provided) -> people fight for supplies -> looting and fighting broke out -> ==lead to casualties and even deaths==

>[!caution] Notice
>Mostly applies to LDCs since they have a **lack** of supplies, and so require **provision** of supplies

## Long-term
### Rebuilding Infrastructure
Rebuild and improve infrastructure after an event of an earthquake

>[!success] Successes
>**Example**: Earthquake in ==Kobe, Japan== in ==**1995**==
>- ==**Billions**== spent to develop technology and build earthquake-proof -> ==lesser destruction of properties== in the future -> ==lesser loss of lives== due to destruction

>[!fail] Limitations
>- Can be costly to do so ==(problem for LDCs)==
>**Example**: Tsunami in ==Chile== in ==**2010**==
>- **Resistance to earthquake $\neq$ resistance to tsunami** -> many earthquake-proof buildings suffered heavy damage from the tsunami => additional protection needed (e.g. coastal protection structures: breakwaters)-> more costly ==(problem for LDCs)==

### Provision of health care
**Trauma** from loss of loved ones / homes / jobs after earthquake -> **mental health care** such as long-term counselling needed

>[!success] Successes
>**Example**: ==**A year**== after earthquake in ==Christchurch, New Zealand== in ==**2011**==
> - Severe problems of anxiety and depression **identified** among all age groups (of affected population) -> **more health workers** deployed in the area to cater to them -> more victims **counselled** -> more victims **recover**

>[!fail] Limitations
>**Example**: After earthquake in ==Haiti== in ==**2010**==
>- Improving health options (e.g. restoring resilience) is **difficult** -> many survivors still continue to lack access to basic necessities -> ==poor quality of life==
>	- -> run away to other countries (e.g. Mexico and USA) for ==better quality of life== -> $\downarrow$ manpower in Haiti -> $\downarrow$ people putting in effort to try to get access to basic necessities -> **positive feedback loop** ($\uparrow$ people running away)
>	- -> cannot survive daily lives post-earthquake -> die of lack of mental strength -> ==loss of lives==

>[!caution] Notice
> (Limitations)
> - More manageable for DCs as they have **supplies** to do so
> - Especially difficult for LDCs as they have **don't have supplies** to do so
