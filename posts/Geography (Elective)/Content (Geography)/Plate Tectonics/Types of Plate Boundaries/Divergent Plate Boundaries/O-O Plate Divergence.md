- Magma **rises** from mantle to the surface -> **cools** and **solidifies** into solid rocks which **moves along** with the crust (due to **seafloor spreading**)
>[!info] Feature of new sea floor
>The **further away** from the plate boundary at the sea floor, the **older** the solid rocks are
- -> form new **sea floor** -> continues and accumulates to form **mid-oceanic ridge** and **split** the ocean basin into half
- At some points on the mid-oceanic ridge, [[Volcanoes]] are formed
