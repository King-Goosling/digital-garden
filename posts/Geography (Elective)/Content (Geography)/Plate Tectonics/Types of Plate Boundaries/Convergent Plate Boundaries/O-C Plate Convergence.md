- When an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, **denser** oceanic plate **subducts beneath** the **less dense** continental plate
- **==Oceanic trench==**[^1] forms at the point of subduction ^1
- Forms [[Fold Mountains]] on the continental plate
- Subducted oceanic plate causes mantle material above it to **melt** to form **magma** ^2
- Magma is **less dense** than mantle material -> **rise** through crust -> form [[Volcanoes]] ^3

[^1]: Similar to [[O-O Plate Convergence#^1|this]], but ==oceanic trench== in [[O-C Plate Convergence]] as compared to ==oceanic trench== in [[O-O Plate Convergence]] is ==less deeper==
[^2]: Similar to [[O-C Plate Convergence#^2|this]]
[^3]: Similar to [[O-O Plate Convergence#^3|this]]
