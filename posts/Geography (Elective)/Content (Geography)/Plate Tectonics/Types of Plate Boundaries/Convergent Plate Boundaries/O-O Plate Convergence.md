- When two oceanic plates converge and collide, the **denser** oceanic plate will **subduct beneath** the **less dense** oceanic plate
- ==**Deep oceanic trench**== forms at the point of subduction[^1]
- Subducted oceanic plate causes mantle material above it to **melt** to form **magma**^2
- Magma is **less dense** than mantle material -> **rise** through crust -> form [[Volcanoes]]^3

[^1]: Similar to [[O-C Plate Convergence#^1|this]], but ==oceanic trench== in [[O-O Plate Convergence]] as compared to ==oceanic trench== in [[O-C Plate Convergence]] is ==deeper==
[^2]: Similar to [[O-C Plate Convergence#^2]]
[^3]: Similar to [[O-C Plate Convergence#^3]]
