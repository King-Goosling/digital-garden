==**Convection currents (C.C.)**== are movements of **heat** within the mantle.

# Grey points
1. Mantle material **heated** by the core
    -> **expands**
    -> becomes **less denser**
    -> **rises** (among the denser surrounding mantle material)
    -> **spreads out** beneath the plates

2. Plates **dragged along** by the mantle material
    -> **move away** from each other
    -> forming a **divergent plate boundary**

3. Hot mantle material **cools**
    -> **sinks** (among the less denser surrounding mantle material)
    -> **pulls plates together** to form a **convergent plate boundary** and a **subduction zone** (if a plate subducts)

4. Sinking mantle material **heats up** again (since it's near the core)
    -> ==process repeats==

# Blue point
5. **==Slab-pull force occurs==** when the denser and sinking (usually oceanic) plate at subduction zones **pull** the rest of the plate behind it.
> Currently thought to be the main driving mechanism for plate movement

6. Subducting/Sinking **plate** drives **downward-moving portion** of covection currents

7. **Mantle material** here (/found away from the subduction zones) drives the **rising portion** of convection currents
