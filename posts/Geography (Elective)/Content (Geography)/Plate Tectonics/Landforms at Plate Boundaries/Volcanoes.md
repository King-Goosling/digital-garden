When plates converge/diverge in convergent/divergent plate boundaries,

- Mantle material **melts** into magma
    -> **expands**
    -> becomes **less denser**
    -> **rises** (among the denser surrounding mantle material)
    -> **accumulates** in ==magma chamber==
    -> pressure builds up

- Magma forces its way through ==vents==, up onto the ==earth's surface==
> Magma -> lava

- Lava **accumulates** around vent
    -> **cools**
    -> **solidifies** 
    -> form ==small cone==
> Repeated eruptions and accumulations -> volcanoes form

- ==Bowl-shape opening== also formed (known as ==crater==)

## Types of Volcanoes
Consist of 
- Shield Volcanoes
- Stratovolcanoes

| Characteristic      | Shield Volcano                                                               | Stratovolcano                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Viscosity of lava   | ==Low==-silica + ==Low== viscosity                                           | ==High==-silica + ==More== viscous                  |
| Movement of lava    | Flows ==easily== + Spreads out over a ==large area== before solidifying (due to **viscosity**)     | ==Resistant== to flow + Solidifies ==more quickly== (due to **viscosity**) |
| Shape of volcano    | ==Low== + ==Broad== summit + ==Gentle== slopes that ==flatten== near the top (due to **movement of lava**) | ==Tall== + ==Steep== top + ==Gentle== base (due to **movement of lava**)          |
| Gases               | Escape easily + Go up vent easily (due to **viscosity**)                                            | Gases trapped + Expand while going up vent (due to **viscosity**)         |
| Type of eruption    | Quiet (due to **gases**)                                                                        | Violent (due to **gases**)                                             |
| Additional features | -                                                                            | Secondary cone (due to **viscosity** $\rightarrow$ vent blocked)                                      |

>[!info] Silica and viscosity
> - Low-silica lava -> Low viscosity
> - High silica lava -> High viscosity
>   
>   **Viscosity** is ==stickness of lava== / ==lava's resistance to flow==

## Formations
### Formation of secondary cone
**High-silica** lava -> cools and solidifies in ==vent== (possibility) -> ==vent== **blocked** -> magma forced to find **new exit route** to surface -> ==secondary vent== developed -> ==secondary cone== developed

### Formation of caldera
==Summit== of volcano **blown off** during eruption (possibility)
    -> sides of ==crater== **collapse** inwards due to **loss of structural support** 
    -> ==large depression== formed (known as ==caldera==)
