When two continental plates converge at convergent plate boundaries,

->Plates and rocks **pushed upward**
-> ==**Compressional force**== creates **immense pressure**
-> Layers of rocks **buckle and fold**, forming **upfold(anticline)** and **downfold(syncline)**
-> After **continuous** buckle and fold, ==[[Fold Mountains]]== are formed

If there is an **increasing ==compressional force==** on one limb of the fold,

-> **Fracture** forms
-> Buckling **stops**
-> Limb **moves forward** and **rides over** the other limb
