When two continental plates diverge at divergent plate boundaries,

-> Due to ==**tensional forces**==, **fault lines** (known as **fractures**) form
- -> As the plates continue to diverge,
	- the central block **sinks**, forming a ==Rift Valley==
	- surrounding land of a block of land **sinks**. **Block of land** which is left standing higher than surrounding land is called ==Block Mountains==
