# Answering techniques (Geography)
## General
1. Write in paragraphs (not necessarily 1 point, 1 paragraph) for tidiness
2. Understand mark allocation: 4 mark question requires 4 points
3. QN: Account for XXX | ANS: Explain ==(account means explain)==
4. Use fig. VS With reference to / help of fig.
    - ==Use fig.==: Use fig. as far as possible (factors must relate to fig.)
    - ==With reference to / help of fig.==: Use fig. at least once (at least one factor must relate to fig.)

5. Take note of limiting factors in question.
    - Does it want overall trend or individual trend?
        - Overall trend: Don't just focus on individual, describe trend with other points in mind (e.g. Maize has the ==highest== growth rate in 1980-1990 at 15%, as compared to rice at 10% and wheat at 8%)
    - Is it just describe or describe and explain?

## Diagrams
Add ==box== surrounding diagram and a ==title== above it

**Annotated diagram:** Diagram with explains following through the process
**Labelled diagram:** Label the objects in the diagram

## LDQ
Q1: '(statement)' How far do you agree? [8]
1. Don't address (statement) only at the ending paragraph, address it when explaining factors

2. (statement) can be foreign, but still has 2 sides of it (e.g. same vs different, etc.)
    - don't need to explain factors, just answer the question with 8 explanations

3. When giving e.g.s, elaborate a lot on the examples (make good use of example to help with desc. and maybe explanation, don't just use e.g. for the sake of using e.g.)
>[!tip] If facing troubles with using examples to help with explanation, just ==state the example before explaining==
4. Adapt explanations according to question

5. Do not neglect the Elaboration in PEEL structure. Use one to two sentences to elaborate, then state examples before explaining.

>[!tip] Examples for LDQ are ==still awarded marks== even though desc/values are wrong/outdated
## GI
Q1: Explain (claim) [4m]
- (claim) because XXX affects YYY (in a way) [1m]
- When XXX increase/decrease from XX to YY, YYY increase/decrease from XX to YY in Figure 1 [1m]
- When XXX increase/decrease from XX to YY, YYY increase/decrease from XX to YY in Figure 2 [1m]
- However, there is an anomaly when ... [1m]
>(ATQ [1m], 2 evidences from graph [2m], 1 anomaly [1m] for this question)
>Generally, ATQ [1m], 2 points [1m], odd factor [1m], since question can change a lot

Q2: State (calculation)
- Show working as well, just in case calculated wrong -> maybe still can get awarded the mark if working correct

Q3a: How to record XXX as accurately as possible? (General)
- Typical answer
Q3b: How **THEY** can record XXX as accurately as possible? (In that scenario)
- Take out irrelevant points of typical answer (that doesn't fit into scenario)
    - ==If students are measuring rainfall in environments differing in tree cover, don't tell them to stay away from trees and buildings==

Q4: Suggest how XXX can be represented in a graph
- Whether it is [2] or [3], must explain in the same way **using STAPL**
- If title already provided, just mention it again. **Stick to STAPL**

Q5: Describe and explain trend [4]
- 2 descriptions and 2 respective explanations required.

Q6: Describe trend
- Use BEST trend you notice (e.g. the majority/minority/highest/lowest)

Q7: Describe steps to take to ensure accuracy
- Must be CLEAR steps. Can memorise them. E.g. for measuring temperature:
	- Hold 1.5m metres above ground (reduce heat gain from ground via long-wave radiation)
	- Hold far away from body (lesser heat gain from body)
	- Parralax error
	- Repeat for 3 consecutive days and find average
	- Wait for 1 minute for level of thermometer to settle
