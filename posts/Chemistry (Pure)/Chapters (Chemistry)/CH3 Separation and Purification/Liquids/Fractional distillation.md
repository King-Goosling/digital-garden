## Fractional distillation
1. Ethanol vapour and water vapour rises up the fractionating column
2. Water vapour will condense onto the glass beads and fallback into the round-bottom flask, whereas ethanol vapour will reach the upper part of the column and goes into the condenser
3. Ethanol vapour loses heat and condenses onto the condenser into ethanol, flowing down into the conical flask (/receiver). Collect ethanol as distillate.
