### Separation of water and oil
1. Pour water and oil into seperating funnel with its tap closed, supported by a retort stand with a conical flask below it
2. Wait for the water and oil to separate completely
3. Open the tap to drain the water out, turning it down so that it drips drop by drop when there is little water left

6. Dispose the contents of the conical flask with a mixture of water and oil
