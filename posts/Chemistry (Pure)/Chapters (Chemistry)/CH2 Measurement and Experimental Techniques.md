## Collection of gas
| Gas                     | Solubility in water | Density compared to air | Method of collection |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Hydrogen $H_2$          | no                  | less                    |  displacement of water                   |
| Oxygen $O_2$            | very slightly       | less                    |              displacement of water        |
| Carbon dioxide $CO_2$   | slightly            | more                    |      displacement of water                |
| Chlorine $Cl_2$         | yes                 | more                    |downward delivery                      |
| Hydrogen chloride $HCl$ | yes                 | more                    |          downward delivery            |
| Sulfur dioxide $SO_2$   | yes                 | more                    | downward delivery                   |
| Ammonia $NH_3$          | yes                 | less                    |          upward delivery            |
