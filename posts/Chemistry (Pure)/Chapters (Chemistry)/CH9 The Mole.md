# CH9 The Mole
## Molar Mass
**Relative atomic mass (A<sub>r</sub>)**
$=$ average mass of an **atom** of the **element** $\div$ $\frac 1{12}$ mass of an atom of carbon-12

**Relative molecular mass (M<sub>r</sub>)**
$=$ average mass of **molecule** of an **element/compound** $\div$ $\frac 1{12}$ mass of an atom of carbon-12

**Molar mass (g/mol)** = A<sub>r</sub> or M<sub>r</sub>

## Mole(mol)
One mole contains ==6 $\times$$\ce{10^23}$==  (as known as ==Avogadro's constant/number==)

## Empirical and Molecular Formulae
Molecular formula: $\ce{N2O4}$
Empirical formula (Simplest ratio): $\ce{NO2}$
