1. Metal atoms of different ==elements== and ==sizes== packed ==irregularly==
2. Regular arrangement of atoms is ==disrupted==
3. ==Difficult== for metal atoms of ==different sizes== to ==slide past one another== when force is applied

## The Reactivity Series
1. metal + cold $H_2O_{(l)}$ -> metal $OH$ + $H_2$
2. metal + $H_2O_{(g)}$ -> metal $O$ + $H_2$

## Blast furnace
$C_{(s)}$ is coke, $Fe_2O_{3(s)}$ is in haematite
1. $\ce C_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} -> CO_{2(g)}$
2. $\ce C_{(s)} + CO_{2(g)} -> 2CO_{(g)}$
3. $\ce Fe_2O_{3(s)} + 3CO_{(g)} -> 2Fe + 3CO_{2(g)}$
4. $\ce CaCO_{3(s)} -> CaO_{(s)} + CO_{2(g)}$
$CaO_{(s)}$ is limestone, a basic oxide, and $SiO_{2(s)}$ is one of the acidic impurities in haematite
5. $\ce CaO_{(s)} + SiO_{2(s)} -> CaSiO_{3(l)}$
$CaSiO_{3(l)}$ is slag

## Steel
-> alloy of iron($Fe$), carbon($C$), and/or other metals
### Uses of steel
| Steel                 | Composition                                              | Properties | Uses |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---- |
| Mild/Low-carbon steel | Iron($Fe$) and carbon($C$)                               | Hard, strong, and malleable           |Car bodies and machinery      |
| High-carbon steel     | Iron($Fe$) and carbon($C$)                               | Strong but brittle           |Knives, hammers, chisels and saws      |
| Manganese steel       | Iron($Fe$), carbon($C$) and manganese(Mn)                | Increased strength and hardness           | Springs and drills     |
| Stainless steel       | Iron($Fe$), carbon($C$), nickel($Ni$) and chromium($Cr$) | Durable and resistant to corrosion           | Cutlery and surgical intruments     |
## Metal carbonates during heating
| Metal carbonate                                                                               | Observation                                                                 | Reason |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Potassium** and **sodium** carbonate $K_2CO_3$ $Na_2CO_3$                                   | Unaffected by heat                                                          |Carbonates are very stable thermally       |
| **Calcium** to **copper(II)** carbonate $CaCO_3$ $MgCO_3$ $ZnCO_3$ $FeCO_3$ $PbCO_3$ $CuCO_3$ | Decompose into **metal oxide** and **carbon dioxide** upon heating   | -       |
| **Silver** carbonate $Ag_2CO_3$                                                                         | Decompose into **metal** and **carbon dioxide** and **oxygen** upon heating | Silver oxide is thermally unstable       |
## Rust vs Corrode
Steel, Iron, and Manganese **corrode**
Steel and Iron **rust**, but Manganese doesn't **rust**
## Rusting
Conditions to **occur**: Air and water
Conditions to **speed up** (not cause): Salt($NaCl$) and acid

$\ce 4Fe+3O_2+2xH_2O \rightarrow 2Fe_2O_3*xH_2O$
### Prevention
1. Using a protective layer (cover with paint and plastic (with [[CH15 Electrolysis#Electroplating|electroplating]])) ^adc2e3
2. Using a sacrifical metal ('sacrifice' a more reactive metal to 'save' the less reactive metal)
    - More reactive metal ==gives electrons== to less reactive metal ==via contact== (also possible using a wire) and prevent less reactive metal from reacting
3. Using alloys (e.g. stainless steel)
