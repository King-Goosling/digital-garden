# Speed of Reaction
Effective collisions: Energy from collision $\ge$ E<sub>a</sub> -> ==chemical reaction occurs==

## Factors affecting Speed of Reaction
-> Conc., pressure, particle size / surface area, temperature, and presense of catalyst

### Conc. of reactants
$\uparrow$ conc.
$\uparrow$ amount of reactant particles
$\uparrow$ ==frequency of collisions
$\uparrow$ frequency of effective collisions
$\uparrow$ speed of reaction==

### Pressure of reactants (gaseous reactants)
$\uparrow$ pressure
$\downarrow$ distance between each reactant particles
$\uparrow$ ==frequency of collisions
$\uparrow$ frequency of effective coliisions
$\uparrow$ speed of reaction

### Particle size / Surface area of reactants (solid reactants)
When solid reactant broken into particles of $\downarrow$ particle size,
$\uparrow$ surface area for reactant particles to collide on
$\uparrow$ ==frequency of collisions
$\uparrow$ frequency of effective coliisions
$\uparrow$ speed of reaction

### Temperature of reactants
$\uparrow$ temperature
$\uparrow$ speed of reactant particles
$\uparrow$ ==frequency of collisions
$\uparrow$ frequency of effective coliisions
$\uparrow$ speed of reaction

>[!danger] Common misconception
Temperature:
>- DOES NOT increase ==energy of particles== (and decrease $\ce E_a$)
>- it increases speed of particles (and increase $f$ of ==collisions== and $f$ of ==effective collisions==)
>
>$\therefore \uparrow$ speed of reaction

### Presence of catalyst
**Characteristic of catalyst**: $\uparrow$ ==speed of reaction== while remaining ==chemically unchanged== at the end of the reaction

**How does it $\uparrow$ speed of reaction**: Provide ==alternative pathway== for the reaction with a $\downarrow$ E<sub>a</sub>

>[!danger] Common misconception
>$\uparrow$ catalyst $\neq$ $\uparrow$ speed of reaction
>**Presence** of catalyst $\uparrow$ speed of reaction, and not the **amount** of catalyst

>[!tip] Factors of catalyst
>Surface area (of catalyst) can affect speed of reaction
>
>$\uparrow$ surface area,
>$\uparrow$ speed of reaction
>
>Similar logic as [[#Particle size / Surface area of reactants (solid reactants)]]

#### Uses of catalysts in industry
| Catalyst                                                         | Use |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Iron (Fe)                                                        | Manufacture of ammonia ($\ce {NH3}$)    |
| Platinum/Rhodium (Pt/Rh)                                         | Catalytic converters    |
| Aluminium oxide / Silicon dioxide ($\ce {Al2O3}$ / $\ce {SiO2}$) |Production of hydrogen ($\ce {H2}$) in cracking process     |
| Maganese(IV) oxide ($\ce {MnO2}$)                                |Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ($\ce {H2O2}$) [$\ce {2H2O2 -> 2H2O + O2}$]     |

#### Enzymes
- $\downarrow$ temp, become **inactive**
- $\uparrow$ temp, **denatured** (i.e. destroyed)
- have **certain** range of pH range at which they work **best**
