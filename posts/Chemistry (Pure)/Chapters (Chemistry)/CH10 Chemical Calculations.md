## Chemical Calculations
**Use mole ratio in chemical equation**

==Limiting reactant==: **Identify** limiting reactant if needed, use limiting reactant to **calculate**.

Remember to **include** the remaining excess reactant if calculating the mass of everything at the end of reaction

==Percentage yield/purity==: **Don**'t use impure reactant to calculate
