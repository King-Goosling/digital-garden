# CH15 Electrolysis
## Groundwork
**Cat**hode: attract **cat**ions
**An**ode: attract **an**ions
### Reaction
It is taken that out of multiple cations and anions, **only the most easily dischargeable one reacts**

$\therefore$ In overall reaction, there is only one reaction at each electrode taking place
### Selective discharge of ions
#### Cations
Refer to [[CH14 Metals#u The Reactivity Series u]]
The ==least reactive== metal discharge the ==easiest==
>[!summary]+ Example: Iron(II) Chloride and Sodium
>Chemical equation: $FeCl_2 + 2Na \rightarrow Fe + 2NaCl$
>Ionic equation: $Fe^{2+} +2Na \rightarrow Fe + 2Na^+$
>
>$\therefore$
>More reactive metal: ==gains charge==
>Less reactive metal: ==discharges==

### Electrolysis
$\rightarrow$ the process of using ==electricity== to ==break down / decompose== a compound

![[Pasted image 20220724155240.png]]
Anode: Positive electrode ==(electrons taken away from it)==

Cathode: Negative electrode ==(electrons received)==

**Due to position of battery, electrons from anode is transferred to cathode**

#### Inert electrodes
- Carbon (graphite)
- Platinum
#### Reaction
>[!hint] Overall reaction
The most easily dischargeable ==anion== and ==cation== in the ==electrolyte== will accumulate at the ==anode== and ==cathode== respectively

Reaction at anode: $\ce 2Cl^-_{(aq)} \rightarrow Cl_{2(g)}+2e^-$
Reaction at cathode: $\ce 2H^+_{(aq)}+2e^- \rightarrow H_{2(g)}$
Overall reaction: $2H^++2Cl^- \rightarrow H_2+Cl_2$
>[!example] Overall reaction for discharging of ==copper== and ==hydroxide==
>Reaction at anode: $4OH^- \rightarrow 2H_2O+O_2+4e^-$
>Reaction at cathode: $Cu^{2+}+2e^- \rightarrow 2Cu$
>Overall reaction: $Cu^{2+}+4OH^- \rightarrow 2H_2O+O_2+2Cu$

>[!tip] ==Overall reaction== is just combining reactions at ==anode== and ==cathode== EXCEPT
>Reaction at anode: $4OH^- \rightarrow 2H_2O+O_2+4e^-$
>Reaction at cathode: $\ce 2H^+_{(aq)}+2e^- \rightarrow H_{2(g)}$
>Overall reaction: $2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2+O_2$
#### Usage
##### Purification of copper
![[Pasted image 20220724161031.png|300]]
Reaction at anode: $\ce Cu_{(s)} \rightarrow Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}+2e^-$
Reaction at cathode: $\ce Cu^{2+}_{(aq)}+2e^- \rightarrow Cu_{(s)}$

Impurities (also known as **anode slime**) such as silver and platinum fall off (they don't get discharge, they just fall off)

$\ce Cu^{2+}$ discharged at cathode is ==mainly from copper anode==
$\rightarrow$ ==no net loss== of $\ce Cu^{2+}$ from electrolyte ($\ce CuSO_{4(aq)}$)
$\rightarrow$ ==colour== + ==conc.== of electrolyte ($\ce CuSO_{4(aq)}$) remain ==unchanged==

##### Electroplating
Similar to [[#purification of copper]]

As mentioned in [[CH14 Metals#^adc2e3]]

### Simple/Galvanic Cell
$\rightarrow$ a device that converts ==chemical energy== to ==electrical energy==

![[Pasted image 20220724151450.png|250]]
Anode: Negative electrode ==(provides electrons)==

Cathode: Positive electrode ==(receives electrons)==

As zinc electrode > copper electrode in terms of reactivity (reflect on [[CH14 Metals#^4bf48c]]), zinc electrode acts as a [[CH14 Metals#Prevention|sacrificial metal]] and provides electrons to copper electrode

#### Reaction
>[!hint] Overall reaction
>1. ==Anode== slowly ==dissolves== and ==decrease in mass==
>2. Most dischargeable ==cation== (including the cation from anode) discharges at ==cathode==

E.g.
Reaction at anode: $\ce Zn_{(s)} \rightarrow Zn^{2+}_{(aq)}+2e^-$
Reaction at cathode: $\ce 2H^+_{(aq)}+2e^- \rightarrow H_{2(g)}$
Overall reaction: $\ce Zn_{(s)}+2H^+_{(aq)} \rightarrow Zn^{2+}_{(aq)}+H_{2(g)}$

#### Level of voltage
$\uparrow$ further apart from each other in the reactivity series
$\uparrow$ voltage produced
