## Air pollutants' effects on humans
| Air pollutants           | Sources                                                                                                                                                         | Effects on humans |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Carbon monoxide $CO$     | ==Incomplete combustion== of fuels                                         |react with ==haemoglobin== in blood and form ==carboxyhaemoglobin==<br>$\downarrow$ reduces ability of haemoglobin to ==transport oxygen== to rest of body<br>$\rightarrow$ headaches, fatigue, breathing difficulties, death         |
| Sulfur dioxide $SO_2$    | 1. ==Burning of sulfur== (present in fuels) $S_{(s)}+O_{2(g)} \rightarrow SO_{2(g)}$<br>2. Released during ==volcanic eruptions==  |1. irritate ==eyes== and ==lungs== and cause ==breathing difficulties==<br>2. high levels lead to ==inflammation of lungs== (bronchitis) 3. react with water in atmosphere to form ==acid rain== (which corrodes buildings and harms aquatic life and plants)         |
| Oxides of nitrogen $N$__ | When temperatures are ==very high== (from burning/lightning), $N_{2(g)}+O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2NO_{(g)}$ and $2NO_{(g)}+O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2NO_{2(g)}$ (brown gas) | $\uparrow$ same as above $\uparrow$          |
| Unburnt hydrocarbons     | Released in ==car exhaust fumes== and ==chemical plants==    |1. cause ==cancer== (it is ==carcinogenic==)<br>2. react with hydrocarbons to form ==ozone==        |
| Methane $CH_4$           | 1. ==Decay== of rubbish, plants, animals<br>2. Farts from ==sheep== and cows |is a ==greenhouse gas== $\rightarrow$ contribute to global warming         |
| Ozone $O_3$              | Nitrogen dioxide + unburnt hydrocarbons $\ce{->[sunlight]}$ ozone  | 1. form photochemical smog (irritates ==eye==, ==lungs== and ==cause breathing difficulties==)<br>2. damage ==crops==        |
## Acid rain
### Formulae
$SO_{2(g)}+H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow H_2SO_{3(aq)}$ (**sulfurous acid**)
$NO_{2(g)} + 2H_2O{(l)} + O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 4HNO_{3(aq)}$
$CO_{2(g)}+H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow H_2CO_{3(aq)}$
### Effects
1. Damage buildings
2. Form $Al^{3+}$ when reacted with $Al(NO_3)_3$ in the soil, which are toxic to plants
3. Cause water bodies to have their pH to high, which is too acidic for aquatic life and plants to survive $\rightarrow$ aquatic life and plants die
## Reducing air pollution
### Acidic rain
**Liming** (dispensing powdered limestone $CaCO_3$) 
- expensive
- temporary prevention
### Catalytic converters
$\rightarrow$ remove pollutants in ==vehicle exhaust gas==
contains
- platinum $Pt$ 
- rhodium $Rh$
**Input**
Hot exhaust gas containing
- carbon monoxide $CO$
- oxides of nitrogen $NO_x$
- unburnt hydrocarbons
**Formulae**
- $2CO_{(g)}+O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2CO_{2(g)}$
- $2NO_{(g)}+2CO_{(g)} \rightarrow N_{2(g)}+2CO_{2(g)}$
- $2NO_{2(g)} + 4CO_{(g)} \rightarrow N_{2(g)} + 4CO_{2(g)}$
- E.g. octane $2C_8H_{18(l)} +25O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 16CO_{2(g)}+18H_2O_{(g)}$
**Output**
- carbon dioxide $CO_2$
- nitrogen $N_2$
- water vapour $H_2O_{(g)}$
#### Motor vehicles
1. Use new materials that are more light weight
    $\downarrow$ weight
    $\downarrow$ fuel required to carry weight
2. Use clean fuels (via fuel cell)
    $\rightarrow$ products of combustion are harmless
    $\downarrow$ damage to environment
3. Use electric cars
    $\downarrow$ exhaust gas emmisions
    $\downarrow$ damage down to environment
### Flue gas desulfurisation
$\rightarrow$ minimise sulfur dioxide $SO_2$ production

**Flue gas**
$\rightarrow$ waste gas formed when fossil fuels undergo combustion (includes $SO_2$)

**Desulfurisation**
$\rightarrow$ removal of sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$)
However, this is
- too expensive
- technologically difficult to accomplish
#### Formulae
##### Using calcium carbonate $CaCO_3$
calcium carbonate + sulfur dioxide $\rightarrow$ calcium sulfite + carbon dioxide
$CaCO_{3(s)}+SO_{2(g)} \rightarrow CaSO_{3(s)}+CO_{2(g)}$

calcium sulfite + oxygen $\rightarrow$ calcium sulfate
$2CaSO_{3(s)}+O_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2CaSO_{4(s)}$

##### Using calcium oxide $CaO$
calcium oxide + sulfur dioxide $\rightarrow$ calcium sulfite
$CaO_{(s)}+SO_{2(g)} \rightarrow CaSO_{3(s)}$

## Ozone layer
**Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)**
$\rightarrow$ are compounds containing elements carbon $C$, fluorine $F$, and chlorine $Cl$

1. Harmful UV radation from Sun is absorbed by protective ozone lyaer
2. ==Coolants in refrigerator== and ==air conditioners== release CFCs
3. CFCs reach stratosphere, where protecive Ozone layer is
4. In presence of UV, CFCs decompose to form chlorine atoms $Cl$
5. $Cl+O_3 \rightarrow$ chlorine oxide and oxygen

## Global warming
### Carbon cycle
$\rightarrow$ a mechanism that ==maintains level== of $CO_2$ in atmosphere
### Causes of $CO_2$ emissions
1. Respiration
    glucose + oxygen $\rightarrow$ carbon dioxide + ==water== + ==energy==
    $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_{2(aq)} \rightarrow 6CO_{2(g)}+6H_2O_{(l)} +$ energy
2. Combustion of fuels
    methane + oxygen $\rightarrow$ carbon dioxide + ==water vapour== + ==heat energy==
    $CH_{4(g)}+2O_{2(g)} \rightarrow CO_{2(g)}+2H_2O_{(g)}+$ heat energy
3. Decay and bacterial decomposition
    $\rightarrow$ dead animals and plants decay
    $\rightarrow$ bacteria break down carbon compound
    $\rightarrow$ $CO_2$ produced in the process
### Reducing $CO_2$ emissions
1. Photosynthesis
    $6CO_2+6H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2$
2. Ocean uptake
    - **Plants** use $CO_2$ for photosynthesis
    - Most of $CO_2$ converted into $CaCO_3$ in form of shells and skeletal remains of **marine organisms**
        $\rightarrow$ Shells and skeletons settle on seabed to form limestone
