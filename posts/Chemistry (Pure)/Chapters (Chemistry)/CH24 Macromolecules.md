## Terms
### Macromolecule
$\rightarrow$ is a **very large molecule** that is made up of **many small molecules**
### Polymer
$\rightarrow$ is a long-chain macromolecule that is linked by many small repeat units known as monomers

## Naming
monomer $\rightarrow$ polymer
$x$ $\rightarrow$ poly$x$

E.g.:
styrene $\rightarrow$ polystyrene 
chloroethene $\rightarrow$ poly(chloroethene)

## Repeating unit
Repeating unit:  ![[ethane (repeating unit).png|80]]
Polymer written using its repeating unit:  ![[polyethene (repeating unit).png|80]] **(bonds cut through the brackets!)**

## Addition Polymerisation

### Definition
is when **unsaturated monomers** join tgt ==without losing any molecules/atoms== to form a ==polymer== called **addition polymer**

### Conditions
- $\uparrow$ high pressure
- $\uparrow$ high temperature
- presence of catalyst

### Formula
ethene $\ce{->[high temperature and pressure][catalyst]}$ poly(ethene)
$n$![[ethene.png|100]] $\ce{->[high temperature and pressure][catalyst]}$![[polyethene (repeating unit).png|100]]

### **Uses** of Addition Polymers
#### Uses of ==poly(ethene)==
since it can easily mould into a lot of shapes, it is used to make
- toys
- clingfilm
- plastic bags
#### Uses of ==other addition polymers==
Perspex: Windscreen of cars
Teflon: Layer on frying pans
Polystyrene: Disposable containers
Polyvinyl chloride: Pipes, raincoats, thin gloves, flooring mats

## Condensation Polymerisation
is when **monomers** combine to form a **polymer** with ==removal of small molecule== (e.g. $H_2O$)

### Polyamide (Nylon)

#### Definition of Polyamide
$\rightarrow$ contains **amide linkages** ![[amide linkage.png|50]]
$\rightarrow$ is a **synthetic fibre**

#### Definition of Nylon
$\rightarrow$ is formed using the below reaction

##### Formula for Nylon
==E.g.:==
**Dicarboxylic acid** and **diamine** forms **nylon** and **water** (removal of water)
![[dicarboxylic acid.png|200]] and ![[diamide.png|180]] forms ![[polyamide.png|200]] and ![[Water.png|100]]

### Polyester (Terylene)

#### Definition of Polyester
$\rightarrow$ contains **ester linkages** ![[ester linkage.png|60]] (recall [[Carboxylic Acids#Esters]])
$\rightarrow$ is a **synthetic fibre**

#### Definition of Terylene
$\rightarrow$ is formed using the below reaction

##### Formula for Terylene
==E.g.:==
**Dicarboxylic acid** and **diol** forms **terylene** and **water** (removal of water)
![[dicarboxylic acid.png|200]] and ![[diol.png|180]] forms ![[polyester.png|200]] and ![[Water.png|100]]

### Uses of Synthetic fibres
- make shrink-proof and crease-proof shirt
- fishing lines
- Terylene for sleeping bag

## Plastic and pollution
### Advantages of plastic
- quite cheap
- can be easily molded into a lot of shapes ![[#Uses of poly ethene]]
- light, tough, and waterproof
- durable
### Biodegradability
**Natural fibres**: Biodegradable
**Synthetic fibres**: Non-biodegradable
