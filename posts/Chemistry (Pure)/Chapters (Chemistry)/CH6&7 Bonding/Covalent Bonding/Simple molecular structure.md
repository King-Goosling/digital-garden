# Simple molecular structure
-> **Atoms** held tgt by ==strong covalent bond== as **molecules**, **molecules** held tgt by ==weak intermolecular forces of attraction==

## Physical properties
1. $\downarrow$ m.p. and b.p.
    - Molecules held tgt by ==weak intermolecular forces of attraction==
    - $\downarrow$ amounts of energy needed to overcome ==weak intermolecular forces of attraction==
    - $\therefore \downarrow$ m.p and b.p.

2. USUALLY insoluble in $H_2O$, soluble in organic solvents
    - EXCEPT for Alcohol, sugar, $NH_3$ , $HCl$, acidic oxides like $SO_2$

3. USUALLY do not conduct electricity at all
    - do not have ==free-moving ions/electrons== to act as ==mobile charge carriers== to conduct electricity
    - EXCEPT for the mentioned exceptions as they form ions when dissolved in $H_2O$ ->  ==free-moving ions== act as ==mobile charge carriers== to conduct electricity
