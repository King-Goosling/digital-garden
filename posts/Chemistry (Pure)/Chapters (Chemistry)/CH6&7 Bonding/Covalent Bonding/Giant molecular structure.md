# Giant molecular structure (GMS)
$\rightarrow$ giant network of atoms that are covalently bonded tgt
## Properties
1. $\uparrow$ high m.p. and b.p.
    - Molecules held tgt by ==strong covalent bonds==
    - $\uparrow$ amounts of energy needed to break ==strong covalent bonds==
    - $\therefore$ $\uparrow$ high m.p and b.p.

2. Insoluble in $H_2O$, insoluble in organic solvents
    - Molecules held tgt by ==strong covalent bonds==
    - Forces of attraction between **GMS** and **solvent molecules** not strong enough to break ==strong covalent bonds==
### Diamond
>[!info] Each (**carbon**) ==covalently bonded== to (**4 carbon**)

3. Does not conduct electricity
    - All valence electrons in atoms used to form covalent bonds
    - No ==free-moving electrons== to act as ==mobile charge carriers== to conduct electricity

### Graphite
>[!info] Each **carbon** ==covalently bonded== to **3 carbons** in a **layer**, **layers** held tgt by ==weak intermolecular forces of attraction==

3. Conducts electricity
    - One valence electron of each carbon atom not used in covalent bonding
    - ==free-moving electrons== to act as ==mobile charge carriers== to conduct electricity

4. Soft and slippery
    - Layers of carbon atoms held loosely by ==weak intermolecular forces of attraction==
    - Able to slide past each other **easily** when **force applied**
