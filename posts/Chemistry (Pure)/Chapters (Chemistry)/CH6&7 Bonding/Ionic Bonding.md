# Ionic Bonding
-> Arranged in a **giant lattice structure**, where each ion of different elements is held tgt by ==ionic bonds==

## Physical properties
$\uparrow$ m.p. and b.p.
- Ions held tgt by **strong** electrostatic forces of attraction
- $\uparrow$ amounts of energy to overcome **strong** electrostatic forces of attraction
- $\therefore \uparrow$ m.p. and b.p.

**USUALLY** soluble in $H_2O$, insoluble in organic solvents
Ions held tgt by **strong** electrostatic forces of attraction
- $H_2O$ ==molecules== **attracted** to ions -> weaken and overcome **strong** electrostatic forces of attraction
- Ions **pulled** from giant lattice structure -> compound dissolves to form $aq$ solution
>Except for insoluble salts in [[CH12 Salts#^639db3]]

Conducts electricity when molten / $aq$ state
- In molten / $aq$ state, ==free-moving ions== present
- ==free-moving ions== act as ==mobile charge carriers== to conduct electricity
