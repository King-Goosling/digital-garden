# Metallic bond
-> **Metal ions** neatly arranged in a **sea of electrons**
- ==strong electrostatic forces of attractions== between **metal ions** and **electrons**
## Properties
1. $\uparrow$ high m.p. and b.p.
    - Atoms in metal packed tgt by ==strong metallic bonds==
    - $\uparrow$ amounts of energy needed to break ==strong metallic bonds==
    - $\therefore$ $\uparrow$ high m.p and b.p.

2. Conducts electricity
    - Valence electrons of metal atoms can
        -> break away easily
        -> move freely within metal lattice
        -> act as ==mobile charge carriers== to conduct electricity

3. **Malleable** (hammered into diff. shapes) and **ductile** (drawn into wires without breaking)
    - Layers of metal atoms can slide over one another easily when force applied

4. Good conductors of heat
    - Thermal energy can easily be transferred by sea of delocalised/mobile electrons 

5. High density
    - Metal atoms and sea of delocalised/mobile electrons packed tightly in layers
