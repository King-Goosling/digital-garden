## Chemical Equation
Just balance
- **NOT** necessary to have state symbols unless **stated**

## Ionic Equation
Only can separate ==aqueous== compounds into ==ions==, **CANNOT** separate ==molecules==
- **Necessary** to have state symbols
- Will **NOT** have $e^-$ in equation (unless asked in for **half equation**)
