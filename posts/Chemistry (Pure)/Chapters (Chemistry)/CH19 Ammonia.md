# CH19 Ammonia
## Reversible reaction
$\ce N_{2(g)}+3H_{2(g)}⇌2NH_{3(g)}$

Forward reaction: $\ce N_{2(g)}+3H_{2(g)} \rightarrow 2NH_{3(g)}$
- combination (cooling required)
Backward reaction: $\ce 2NH_{3(g)} \rightarrow N_{2(g)}+3H_{2(g)}$
- decomposition (heating required)

In formula of AMMONIUM SALTS (not ammonia),

|                   | Type of reaction | Conditions       | E.g. reaction |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Forward reaction  | combination      | cooling required | $NH_3 + HCl \rightarrow NH_4Cl$              |
| Backward reaction | decomposition    | heating required | $NH_4Cl \rightarrow NH_3 + HCl$              |
## Manufacturing of Ammonia
$\rightarrow$ makes $\ce NH_{3(g)}$ out of $\ce N_{2(g)}$ and $H_{2(g)}$ 

$\ce N_{2(g)}$: obtained from fractional distillation of air
$H_{2(g)}$: produced from cracking of petroleum (refer to [[Homologous series experiments#Producing alkenes by cracking]] )
### Haber process
#### Requirements
- Pressure of 250atm
- Temperature of 450°C
- Presence of Iron($\ce Fe$) catalyst
#### Process
![[Manufacture of ammonia.gif|500]]
Formation of ammonia is a reversible reaction
$\rightarrow$ not all $\ce N_{2(g)}$ and $H_{2(g)}$ will react to form $\ce NH_{3(g)}$
$\rightarrow$ unreacted $\ce N_{2(g)}$ and $H_{2(g)}$ are pumped back to the reactor for further reaction to form $\ce NH_{3(g)}$

Ammonia cools and condenses in the cooling chamber into liquid ammonia
### Factors affecting yield of Ammonia, speed of reaction, and cost
|                        | Yield of Ammonia                      | Speed of reaction                   | Cost                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| $\uparrow$ Pressure    | $\uparrow$ (lower limit)              | $\uparrow$ (lower limit) | $\uparrow$ (upper limit) |
| $\uparrow$ Temperature | $\downarrow$ (upper limit) | $\uparrow$ (lower limit) | $\uparrow$ (upper limit) |

#### Pressure
$\uparrow$ pressure
$\uparrow$ yield of ammonia
+
$\uparrow$ pressure
$\uparrow$ speed of reaction (refer to [[CH18 Speed of Reaction#u Pressure of reactants gaseous reactants u]])

However,
$\uparrow$ pressure
$\uparrow$ cost (equipment used are expensive)
#### Temperature
$\downarrow$ temp.
$\downarrow$ rate of decomposition of ammonia
$\uparrow$ yield of ammonia

However,
$\downarrow$ temp.
$\downarrow$ speed of reaction

But,
$\downarrow$ temp.
$\downarrow$ cost (to maintain)
#### Catalyst
Reaction is still slow even with $\uparrow$ pressure and $\uparrow$ temp. Catalyst is used to $\uparrow$ speed of reaction
