# Introduction to Organic Chemistry
## Terms
#### Organic Compounds
Compounds containing carbon element ($\ce C$)
#### Hydrocarbons
==Organic compounds== which only contain
    - carbon element ($\ce C$)
    - hydrogen element ($\ce H$)
#### Homologous Series
A family of ==organic compounds==
- with **same** ==functional group==
- with **similar** chemical properties
- where each member of the group differs from the previous member by an extra $\ce CH_2$ **group of atoms**
#### Functional Group
==A(n group of) atom(s)== that give(s) the molecule its ==characteristic properties==

*What is a characteristic property?
A physical/chemical property that's unique to a particular substance*
#### Petroleum / Crude oil
Naturally occuring **mixture** of ==hydrocarbons==
#### Natural gas
Consist of:
- methane (majority)
- ethane
- propane
- butane
#### Fossil Fuels
Consist of:
- Petroleum / Crude oil
- Natural gas
#### Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)
Liquefied form of petroleum gas
#### Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
Liquefied form of natural gas
## Fractional Distillation of Petroleum
$\rightarrow$ seperates petroleum for specific and useful fractions
![[Fractional Distillation of Crude Oil.gif|500]]
#### How does it work?
Bigger hydrocarbons
- ==bigger== $\ce M_r$
- ==stronger== intermolecular forces of attraction
- ==higher== b.p. and m.p.
>[!hint] As a result,
>$\rightarrow$ temp. ==too hot== for hydrocarbon to be in liquid
>$\rightarrow$ hydrocarbon boils to a gaseous state
>
>Due to ==high== b.p., the high temperature in lower columns is ==low enough== for hydrocarbons to condense as liquid
>
>$\rightarrow$ hydrocarbon condense into liquid at ==lower== columns
>$\rightarrow$ hydrocarbon collected in ==lower== columns

Smaller hydrocarbons
- ==smaller== $\ce M_r$
- ==weaker== intermolecular forces of attraction
- ==lower== b.p. and m.p.
>[!hint] As a result,
>$\rightarrow$ temp. ==too hot== for hydrocarbon to be in liquid
>$\rightarrow$ hydrocarbon boils to a gaseous state
>
>Due to ==low== b.p., the high temperature in lower columns is still ==too high== for hydrocarbons to condense as liquid
>
>$\rightarrow$ hydrocarbon is able to remain in ==gaseous state== and rise up to ==higher== columns
>$\rightarrow$ hydrocarbon collected in ==higher== columns (where temperature is cooler to allow condensation)
#### What does it contain?
| Petroleum fractions | Physical state | Uses                          |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Petroleum gas       | Gas            | Fuel for ==cooking== and ==heating== |
| Petrol/Gasoline     | Liquid         | Fuel for ==motor vehicles==                              |
| Naphtha             | Liquid         | Used as ==chemical feedstock== to make other chemicals (plastic/detergent)                             |
| Kerosene/Paraffin   | Liquid         | Fuel for ==cooking==, ==heating==, and ==jet/planes==                              |
| Diesel oil          | Liquid         | Fuel for ==heavy vehicles== (buses/lorries/trains)                              |
| Lubricating oil     | Liquid         | Used to ==reduce friction== between moving machine parts (as wax/polish)                              |
| Bitumen             | Solid          | Used for ==road surfaces==                              |
#### Competing uses of petroleum as ==energy source== and ==chemical feedstock==

Petroleum is
- ==non-renewable== source of energy
- ==limited==

Both usages are important,
- 90% of petroleum is used to ==generate heat and electricity==
- 10% of petroleum is used to ==manufacture daily products== for the public

**$\uparrow$ growing use of petroleum
$\uparrow$ growing need to conserve them**
