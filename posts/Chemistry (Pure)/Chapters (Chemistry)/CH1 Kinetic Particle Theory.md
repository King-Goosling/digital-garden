# Kinetic Particle Theory
-> states that all matter is made up of **tiny particles** which are in **constant** and **random** motion. ^0a6835

## Characteristics of Matter
|        | Arrangement                                  | Forces of attraction | Movement                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Solid  | **very closely** packed + **orderly** manner | **very strong**      | **CANNOT** move about freely, can only **vibrate vigorously** at their ==fixed positions==                                    |
| Liquid | **closely** packed + **disorderly** manner   | **strong**           | Move about **freely** ==throughout liquid== |
| Gas    | **very far apart** from one another + **disorderly** manner          | **weak**             | Move **quickly** and **randomly**                                    |

#### A
Thermal energy absorbed by the particles of the solid as **kinetic energy** -> particles ==vibrate faster about their fixed positions==

>only solid present

#### B
Thermal energy taken in by particles of the solid is used to ==overcome the forces of attraction==

>mixture of solid & liquid present

#### C
- Particles are no longer have these [[CH1 Kinetic Particle Theory#Solids|characteristics(solid)]], and will have these [[CH1 Kinetic Particle Theory#Liquids|characteristics(liquid)]] instead

Thermal energy absorbed by the particles of the liquid as **kinetic energy** -> particles ==move faster==

>only liquid present

#### D
Thermal energy taken in by particles of the liquid is used to ==overcome the forces of attraction==

>mixture of liquid & gas present

#### E
- Particles are no longer have these [[CH1 Kinetic Particle Theory#Liquids|characteristics(liquid)]], and will have these [[CH1 Kinetic Particle Theory#Gases|characteristics(gas)]] instead

Thermal energy absorbed by the particles of the liquid as **kinetic energy** -> ==particles move faster==

>only gas present

>[!summary] Answering technique
> 1. Thermal energy absorbed by particles as **kinetic energy** -> particles ==vibrate faster about their fixed positions== / ==move faster==
> 
> 2. Thermal energy taken in by particles to ==overcome forces of attraction== (mixture of XXX state & YYY state present)
>
> 3. Particles no longer have [characteristics of previous state], and will have [characteristics of current state]

## Evaporation vs boiling
|       | Evaporation                          | Boiling                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Temp  | Occurs at **any** temp                   | Occurs at **b.p.** only      |
| Place | Occurs only at the **surface** of liquid | Occurs **throughout** liquid |
| Speed | Occurs **slowly**                        | Occurs **rapidly**           |

## Diffusion
- is the movement of particles from ==region of higher conc.== -> ==region of lower conc.== in liquids and gases

H<sub>2</sub> diffuse into O<sub>2</sub> & O<sub>2</sub> diffuse into H<sub>2</sub> to form a ==homogeneous== gas

>[!info] Homogeneous: evenly spread out

### Factors affecting rate of diffusion
1.  conc. gradient (the difference of concentration of the two gases/liquids)
	- $\uparrow$ conc. gradient, $\uparrow$ rate of diffusion
2. relative molecular mass
	- $\downarrow$ relative molecular mass, $\uparrow$ rate of diffusion
3. temperature
	- $\uparrow$ temperature, $\uparrow$ kinetic energy of molecules, $\uparrow$ rate of diffusion
