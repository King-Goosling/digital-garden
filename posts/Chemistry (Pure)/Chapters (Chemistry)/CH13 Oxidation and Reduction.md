# Oxidation and Reduction
|                 | Oxidation | Reduction |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Oxygen          | $\uparrow$ Gain      |  $\downarrow$ Lose        |
| Hydrogen        | $\downarrow$ Lose         |   $\uparrow$ Gain        |
| Electron        | $\downarrow$ Lose         |    $\uparrow$ Gain       |
| Oxidation state |  $\uparrow$ Increase         |  $\downarrow$ Decrease        |

==Redox reaction== -> both ==oxidation== and ==reduction== take place

>[!hint] Tips
>==Neutralision== is **not** a redox reaction
>
>==Displacement==, ==combination== (e.g. corrosion), ==decomposition== and ==combustion== are redox reactions

>[!danger] Oxidation state VS Charge
>E.g. $FeCl_2$
>
>Oxidation state of $Fe$: ==+2==
>Charge of $Fe$: ==2+==

| Oxidation state    | -                                                        | Hydrogen sulfide ($\ce {H2S}$) (give $\ce S$ to others -> $\downarrow$ oxidation state) |
| Give Oxygen and Hydrogen    | Oxygen($\ce O$) (give $\ce O$ to others -> oxidise them) | Hydrogen($\ce H$) (give $\ce H$ to others -> reduce them)                               |
|Displacement     | More reactive halogens (displacement)                    | More reactive metals (displacement)                                                     |
| Basic reactions    | Acids (in reaction with metals)                                                    | Carbon and carbon monoxide in blast furnace ($\ce C$ & $\ce CO$)                        |
| Testing    | **Acidified** potassium manganate(VII) ($\ce {KMnO4}$)                 | Potassium iodide ($\ce {KI}$)                                                           |
| Just remember    | **Acidified** potassium dichromate(VI) ($\ce {K2Cr7O7}$)               | Sulfur dioxide ($\ce {SO2}$)                                                            |

## Tests
Reducing agent $\ce {->[test for]}$ Oxidising agent
Oxidising agent $\ce {->[test for]}$ Reducing agent

### Test for oxidising agent
$\ce {2I^-}_{(aq)}(colourless) -> {I_2}_{(aq)}(brown) + 2e^-_{(aq)}$ 
>where $\ce 2e^-$ can be represented as an anion of another reacting element

#### Testing a liquid
Aqueous potassium iodide ($\ce {KI}$): ==colourless -> brown==

#### Testing a gas
Starch-iodide paper: ==white -> blue==
(iodine reacts with starch to give blue colour)

### Test for reducing agent
$\ce {MnO4}^-_{(aq)}(purple) + 8H^+_{(aq)} + 5e^-_{(aq)} -> Mn^{2+}_{(aq)}(colourless) + 4{H_2O}_{(l)}$
>where $\ce 8H^+_{(aq)}$ is from the acid, and $\ce 5e^-_{(aq)}$ can be represented as an anion of another reacting element

#### Testing a liquid
Acidified aqueous potassium manganate(VII) solution: ==purple -> colourless==

#### Testing a gas
Filter paper soaked with acidified aqueous potassium manganate(VII) solution: ==purple -> white==
