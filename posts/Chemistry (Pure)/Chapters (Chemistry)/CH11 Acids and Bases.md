# Acids and Bases
## Acids
### Properties of acids
1. **Sour** taste
2. Dissolve in water to form a solution that can conduct **electricity**
3. Turn blue litmus paper red

### Reactions
4. acid + metal -> salt + $\ce {H2}$ (except copper, silver, gold and lead (form insoluble layer))
5. acid + XXX $\ce (H)CO_3$ -> salt + $\ce {H2O} + {CO_2}$
6. acid + XXX $\ce O$ / XXX $\ce OH$ -> salt + $\ce {H2O}$

### Uses
| Acid                              | Uses |
| --------------------------------- | ---- |
| Hydrochloric acid ($\ce HCl$)      |Clean ==impurities== (e.g. rust)      |
| Ethanoic acid ($\ce CH_3COOH$) | Used in **vinegar** to ==preserve food== and ==enhance flavour==     |
| Phosphoric acid ($\ce H_3PO_4$)  | Give food a ==sour== taste     |
| Sulfuric acid ($\ce H_2SO_4$)  | Manufacture of ==fertilisers== and ==detergents==, and as ==battery acid== in cars     |

## Bases and Alkalis
### Base
-> metal (hydr)oxide that reacts with acid to form salt and $\ce H_2O$ only

### Alkali
-> soluble base

### Properties
1. Bitter taste and feel soapy
2. React with acid to form salt and $\ce H_2O$ only
3. Turn red litmus paper blue

### Reaction
4. alkali + XXX $\ce NH_4$ -> salt + $\ce H_2O + NH_3$
5. alkali + soluble metal salt -> metal salt + metal $\ce OH$
    $\ce 2NaOH + FeSO_4$ -> $\ce Na_2SO_4 + Fe(OH)_2$
	- **switch** cations and anions

### Uses
| Base/Alkali                                                       | Uses |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Magnesium oxide ($\ce MgO$)                                       |==Antacid== to relieve gastric pain + Making of ==refractory bricks==      |
| Sodium hydroxide ($\ce NaOH$) and potassium hydroxide ($\ce KOH$) | Preparation of ==soap==     |
| Calcium hydroxide ($\ce Ca(OH)_2$)                                | Reduce ==acidity== in soil     |
| Ammonia solution ($\ce NH_{3(aq)}$)                               | Make ==fertilisers==     |

## Role of water
-> Ionises acids and alkalis to form $\ce H^+$ ions and $\ce {OH}^-$ ions respectively (if not no reaction)

## Strength and Concentration
Strong acid: **Completely** ionises in aq solution
    $\rightarrow$ solution will have higher conc. of $\ce H^+$
    
Weak acid: **Partially** ionises in aq solution
    $\rightarrow$ solution will have lower conc. of $\ce H^+$
(==always fixed amount==, e.g. if one molecule reacts, an unionised one ionises) ^244a17

One mole of **monobasic** acid: 1 mole $\ce H^+$ ionises (e.g. $\ce HCl$)
One mole of **dibasic** acid: 2 moles $\ce H^+$ ionise (e.g. $\ce H_2SO_4$)
One mole of **tribasic** acid: 3 moles $\ce H^+$ ionise (e.g. $\ce H_3PO_4$)

### Order of acidity
monobasic acid < dibasic acid < tribasic acid

### Strength of acid
-> determined by **extent of ionisation** (ratio of $H^+$ ionised VS $H^+$ NOT ionised), which CANNOT be affected by **vol.** and **conc.**

>[!danger] pH level $\neq$ strength of acid
>**pH level**: amount of $H^+$ ions in solution (CAN be affected by **vol.** and **conc.**)
>**strength of acid**: extent of ionisation of $H^+$ ions in solution (CANNOT be affected by **vol.** and **conc.**)

## pH Scale
### pH level
-> measures the amount of $H^+$ ions in the solution, which CAN be affected by **vol.** and **conc.**

>[!danger] pH level $\neq$ strength of acid
>**pH level**: amount of $H^+$ ions in solution (CAN be affected by **vol.** and **conc.**)
>**strength of acid**: extent of ionisation of $H^+$ ions in solution (CANNOT be affected by **vol.** and **conc.**)
