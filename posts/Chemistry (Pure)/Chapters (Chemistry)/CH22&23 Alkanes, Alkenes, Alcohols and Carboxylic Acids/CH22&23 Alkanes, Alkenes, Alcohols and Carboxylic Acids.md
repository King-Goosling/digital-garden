### Fats and Oils
*Why are fats solid at r.t.p.?*
They contain **mainly** ==saturated fat molecules==, which are **straight-chained**
$\rightarrow$ can be packed closely
$\rightarrow$ can form solid

*Why are oils liquid at r.t.p*
They contain **higher percentage** of ==unsaturated fat molecules==, which are not **straight-chained**
$\rightarrow$ cannot be packed very closely
$\rightarrow$ cannot form solid, only can form liquid

*Formula regarding fats and oils*
Oil (**vegetable oil**) + hydrogen $\ce{->[200°C, nickel]}$ fats (**margarine**)
(It's [[Alkenes#a Hydrogenation Addition of hydrogen|hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen)]])

### Isomers
1. $=$ ==molecular formula==, but ≠ ==structural formula== (straight-chain or branched chain?)
2. $\neq$ physical properties (e.g. m.p. and b.p.)

>[!danger] This is still a straight-chain alkane!
>![[bent buthane.png|200]]
>It's just 'bent'

#### Naming of branches
| Number of carbon atoms (of branches) | First name |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| 1                                    | methyl     |
| 2                                    | ethyl      |
| 3                                    | propyl     |
| 4                                    | butyl      |
| 5                                    | pentyl     |
| 6                                    | hexyl      |
| 7                                    | heptyl     |
| 8                                    | octyl      |
>[!danger] Branches are always shorter than 'main branch'!
>There's no such thing as butyl propane - it's propyl butane
>
>However, there is such thing as propyl methanoate (positioning matters because of ester linkage)
