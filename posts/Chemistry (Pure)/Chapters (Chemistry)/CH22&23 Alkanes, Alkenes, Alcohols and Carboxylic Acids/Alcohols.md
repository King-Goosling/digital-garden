# Alcohols
## Properties

### Physical properties
Similar to [[Alkanes#Physical properties]]
#### 4. $\downarrow$ solubility
As $\uparrow$ size of molecules,

$\downarrow$ percentage of hydroxyl in same mass of smaller alcohol molecules
$\downarrow$ solubility

### Chemical properties
#### 1. Combustion
alcohol + oxygen $\rightarrow$ carbon dioxide + water ==vapour==

E.g.:
$\ce 2CH_3OH+3O_2 \rightarrow 2CO_2+4H_2O$
$\ce 2C_2H_5OH+6O_2 \rightarrow 4CO_2+6H_2O$
$\ce 2C_3H_7OH+9O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2+8H_2O$
$\ce2C_4H_9OH+12O_2 \rightarrow 8CO_2+10H_2O$
>[!hint] ==Always 2== alcohol molecules needed
#### 2. Oxidation
##### 2. a) Oxidation by Oxidising agent
Experiment in [[Homologous series experiments#Oxidation of alcohol]]

alcohol + oxygen from oxidising agent $\ce{->[heat]}$ carboxylic acid + water
>[!tip] Oxidising agent can be represented as [O]

propanol + oxygen from oxidising agent $![[Pasted image 20220806222630.png]]$ propanoic acid + water
![[Propanol.png|150]]  + $[O]$ $\ce{->[heat]}$ ![[Propanoic acid.png|150]] + ![[Water.png|80]]

##### 2. B) Oxidation by atmospheric oxygen
ethanol + oxygen from air $\ce{->[bacteria]}$ ethanoic acid + water

###### Used for breathalysers
to test alcohol consumption of drivers

#### 3. Reaction with carboxylic acids
Refer to [[Carboxylic Acids#4 Reaction with alcohols Esterification]]

### Uses of ethanol ($CH_3OH$)
- Alcoholic drinks 🍹
- Solvent (for [[Chromatography]])
- Fuel for ⛽
    - cars 🚗
    - cooking 🍳
