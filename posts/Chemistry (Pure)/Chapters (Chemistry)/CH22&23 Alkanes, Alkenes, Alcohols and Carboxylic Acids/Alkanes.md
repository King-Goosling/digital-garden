# Alkanes
---
*Why are alkanes generally unreactive?*

They only contain
- carbon-carbon single bonds
- carbon-hydrogen bonds

These bonds are ==strong== and are ==difficult to break==

$\therefore$ Alkanes are generally unreactive

## Properties
### Physical properties
When $\uparrow$ size of molecules ...

#### 1. $\uparrow$ m.p. and b.p.
As $\uparrow$ size of molecules,

$\uparrow$ intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules
$\uparrow$ energy required to overcome intermolecular forces of attraction
$\uparrow$ m.p. and b.p.

#### 2. $\uparrow$ viscosity
As $\uparrow$ size of molecules,

$\uparrow$ intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules
$\uparrow$ viscosity

#### 3. $\downarrow$ flammability + $\uparrow$ smoke produced during combustion

As $\uparrow$ size of molecules,

$\uparrow$ amount of carbon atoms
$\uparrow$ oxygen gas required to combust 
1. $\downarrow$ ==flammability==
2. $\uparrow$ molecules go through incomplete combustion (due to lack of oxygen gas)
   $\uparrow$ ==smoke== produced
### Chemical properties
#### 1. Combustion
alkane + oxygen $\rightarrow$ carbon dioxide + water ==vapour==

E.g.:
$\ce CH_4+2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2+2H_2O$
$\ce 2C_2H_6+7O_2 \rightarrow 4CO_2+6H_2O$
$\ce C_3H_8+5O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2+4H_2O$
$\ce2C_4H_{10}+13O_2 \rightarrow 8CO_2+10H_2O$
>[!hint] If number of carbon atoms is ==even==, ==two== alkanes molecules are needed
#### 2. Substitution reactions
alkane + halogen $\ce{->[UV light]}$ haloalkane + hydrogen chloride

propane + chlorine $\ce{->[UV light]}$ chloropropane + hydrogen chloride
![[Propane.png|150]] + ![[Chlorine.png|60]] $\ce{->[UV light]}$ ![[Chloropropane.png|150]] + ![[Hydrogen chloride.png|60]]

chloropropane + chlorine $\ce{->[UV light]}$ ==di==chloropropane + hydrogen chloride
![[Chloropropane.png|150]] + ![[Chlorine.png|60]]  $\ce{->[UV light]}$ ![[Dichloropropane.png|150]] + ![[Hydrogen chloride.png|60]]

dichloropropane + chlorine $\ce{->[UV light]}$ ==1,1,2-tri==chloropropane + hydrogen chloride
![[Dichloropropane.png|150]] + ![[Chlorine.png|60]]  $\ce{->[UV light]}$ ![[1,1,2-trichloropropane.png|150]] + ![[Hydrogen chloride.png|60]]

##### a) Reaction happens one at a time
##### B) Prefixes are added to the alkane
###### I) Halogens
| Halogen           | Prefix  |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| halogen (general) | halo-   |
| fluorine          | fluoro- |
| chlorine          | chloro- |
| bromine           | bromo-  |
| iodine            | iodo-   |
###### II) Numerical prefixes
| Number | Prefix |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1      | mono-  |
| 2      | di-    |
| 3      | tri-   |
| 4      | tetra- |
| 5      | penta- |
| 6      | hexa-  |
| 7      | hepta- |
| 8      | octa-  |
=='mono-' prefix isn't necessary in some cases, like this one==
##### C) ![[what-do-they-mean-random.gif|300]]
Number refers to the carbon the halogen is bonded to.

In '1,1,2', ==two== halogens is bonded to the ==first== carbon atom, and ==one== halogen is bonded to the ==second== carbon atom.

Order depends on which carbon atom is bonded to the ==first== halogen. It's either:
- far right
- far left

### Cracking of Petroleum
is breaking down of ==long-chain hydrocarbons== to form ==smaller molecules==

*Experiment at [[Homologous series experiments#Cracking in school laboratories]]*

$\rightarrow$ can use aluminium oxide ($Al_2O_3$) and silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) as catalysts
#### Reaction
long-chain alkane $\rightarrow$ shorter-chain alkanes + short-chain alkenes + hydrogen
>[!tip] Formula can be flexible (allowed to leave out some products, just make sure formula is ==balanced==)
#### Importance of cracking
##### 1. Produce short-chain alkenes
Useful for [[CH24 Macromolecules#Addition Polymerisation]]
##### 2. Produce Hydrogen
##### 3. Produce Petrol
Short-chain hydrocarbons (e.g. petrol) are ==higher in demand== than long-chain hydrocarbons (e.g. diesel)

Long-chain hydrocarbons can be ==converted== into short-chain hydrocarbons through cracking to ==meet said demand==
