## Producing ethanol by fermentation (production of ==wine==)
glucose solution $\ce{->[yeast]}$ ethanol + carbon dioxide
$C_6H_{12}O_{6(aq)} \ce{->[yeast]} 2C_2H_5OH_{aq}+2CO_{2(g)}$

### Precautions

#### 1. Temp. in mixture should be kept at ~37°C
Enzymes in yeast work best at ~37°C
##### Why?
- If temp. too high, enzymes will ==denature==
- If temp. too low, enzymes will become ==inactive==
(Recall [[CH18 Speed of Reaction#u Enzymes u]])

#### 2. Apparatus is air-tight
Air cannot enter the apparatus since
- ==rubber bang== secured tightly (at flat-bottom flask)
- opening end of ==delivery tube== submerged in limewater
##### Why?
Presence of oxygen and bacteria from air can oxidise ethanol to form ethanoic acid

ethanol + oxygen from air $\ce{->[bacteria]}$ ethanoic acid + water

(Refer to [[Alcohols#2 B Oxidation by atmospheric oxygen]])

### Disadvantages
#### 1. Low yield
*A dilute solution of ethanol is produced, up to only about **15%** concentration.*
When alcohol content exceeds this concentration,
$\rightarrow$ yeast dies
$\rightarrow$ fermentation stops

#### 2. Long duration
Fermentation is a slow process

>[!hint] Can contract and say 'put it in a water bath' in 3rd step

>[!question] What's the point of the 4th step?
>Since ==water== will be produced as well, the 4th step lets the liquids ==settle and seperate== (with ester on top, and water below since ester is **less denser** than water)
>
>Similar to [[Separating funnel]]
