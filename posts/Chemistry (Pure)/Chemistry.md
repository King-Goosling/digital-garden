## Miscellaneous
Limewater + $\ce CO_2$ -> white ppt formed
$\ce Ca(OH)_{2(aq)} + CO_{2(g)} -> CaCO_{3(s)} + H_2O_{(l)}$

$CaO + H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2$

Slaked lime: Dried $\ce Ca(OH)_{2(aq)}$
Limewater: $\ce Ca(OH)_{2(aq)}$ saturated in solution
Quicklime: $\ce CaO_{(aq)}$
Limestone: $\ce CaCO_{3(s)}$
