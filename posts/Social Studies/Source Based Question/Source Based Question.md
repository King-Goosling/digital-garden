# Useful terms
**vested interest**: hidden motive

# Useful notes
1. Source C and D differ in their accounts of their attacks. Does this mean that one of them must be wrong?
    - ==ATQ==: Phrase **answer** in same way as **question**
    - 'Source C and D differ in their accounts of their attacks' $\rightarrow$ difference in content stated $\rightarrow$ no point in comparing content (no marks will be awarded)
2. **Annotate** all sources

# Marking Scheme
>[!hint] General mark allocation
>Content < Cross-reference < Tone, Language or other unique pointers
## Similarity vs Difference
Difference and similarity doesn't matter. What matters is the level of answer given.
>[!example]
>**1st para**: Similar based on content (L3/3)
>**2nd para**: Different based on tone (L4/5)

Thanks to 2nd para, 1st para can be totally ignored (but it's still serves as a safety net)

# Source Based Question
>[!danger] Length of elaboration
>**Non-evaluative**: Elaboration can be 1-2 liner (to save time)
>**Evaluative**: Elaboration can be more lengthy (to achieve higher marks)

## Inference
$\rightarrow$ should link it back to the ==guiding question== most of the time, but it should not be exactly like the ==guiding question== (add more details to it)

Inference is inherently simple - do not infer too much. However, inference mustn't be so simple such that it is **DIRECTLY** lifted or **PARAPHRASED** from source.

Elaboration must still be possible

### Guiding format
- problems
- causes
- impacts
    - positive
    - negative
- reasons
- solutions

## Comparison
$\rightarrow$ must be a ==DIRECT MATCH== in comparison (valid Common Criteria)

When question did not ask for comparison between reliability/usefulness, it is still possible to ==compare their views==.

For example,
- Is it biased, or one-sided?
- Is it objective, or subjective?
- Is it fact-based, or opinion-based?
>[!danger] Take note!
>For a Source to have a balanced viewpoint, it must have
>- +ve and -ve views
>- NOT JUST DIFFERING VIEWS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE
>
>End off with:
>Since it has +ve and -ve views, it has a balanced viewpoint

### Guiding format
**1st para**: Comparison based on content (safety net)
    - DO NOT PARAPHRASE (quote more evi to use if needed)

**2nd para**: Comparison based on view (generally higher mark)
>[!hint] But not limited to this!
>Sometimes, ==unique answers== might be the HIGHEST LEVEL ANSWER. It has no clear structure, but it has a mix of answering techniques.
>
>Write one if you find one!

## Comparing surprise
Use one Source to cross-refer to ==base source== (or both sources according to question)
- Compare based on **Common Criteria** as used previously
- Conclude by saying that Source proves that [question focus]

### Guiding format
>[!example] Example: Having read Source A, are you surprised by Source B?
>**1st para**: Yes/No, I am (not) surprised because there's similarity/difference in content
>**2nd para**: Source A
>**3rd para**: Source B
>**4th para**: Since B contradicts A, I am surprised by B
==[Surprised based on what it says $\rightarrow$ SAFETY NET SECURED]==
>**5th para**: However, I am not surprised after cross-referencing to Source C 
>==OR==
>**5th para**: I am still surprised after cross-referencing to Source C
>**(use same C.C. as A and B!)**
>**6th para**: Source C
>**7th para**: Since C supports B, and contradicts A, I am not surprised by B
>==OR==
>**7th para**: Since C contradicts B, and supports A, I am surprised by B
==[Surprised based on Cross-Reference $\rightarrow$ CHANCE TO SCORE HIGHER]==

## Comparing reliability
Does Source A show that Source B is wrong?

1. Sim/Diff in content
2. Reliability
    - Yes because Source B is unreliable
    - Yes because Source A is reliable
    - No because Source A is unreliable

## Comparing usefulness
Use techniques stated in [[#Reliability Usefulness]] to prove that one of the Source is useful, and the other is not useful.

E.g. Is Source A more useful than Source B?

Yes, because Source A is more useful as it is unbiased in saying (the truth) that ... , whereas Source B is one-sided in (saying / giving his view) that ...

## Reliability/Usefulness

#### Provenance
$\rightarrow$ must not be stand-alone. It can go along with [[#motive]] most of the time

Most of the time, provenance is **ACADEMIC EXPERT**. Do take note:

*Where are they from?*
E.g.:
- Chief Executive of ==Singapore Government Investment Corporation== $\rightarrow$ expert in ==economy==
- Professor in ==Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy== $\rightarrow$ expert in ==policy==

*Is their expertise in a relevant field?*
It doesn't make sense to say a math professor is reliable in talking about minimum wage

*Is provenance supported by content/tone/language?*
Even if provenance is reliable, they can be unreliable based on what they say
 
#### Context
**Countries**
Source A: Offers a solution in ==Singaporean== context
Source B: Talks about a problem in ==Canadian== context

$\therefore$ A cannot help B (diff country context)

**Time**
Source A: Offers a solution in ==2011==
Source B: Talks about a problem in ==2018==

$\therefore$ A may not be able to help B (even though solution is given 7 years ago, problem still arised in 2018)

#### Motive
*What is the purpose of the Source?*
$\rightarrow$ support it with [[#provenance]]

*How does its purpose proves the Source's (im)partiality?*
~ The creator is the Source is from XXX, and would want to put XXX ==in good light==. Therefore, creator would be ==bias== towards XXX. Since it is ==one-sided==, Source is ==unreliable==.
(HIDDEN AGENDA)

#### Tone and Language
$\rightarrow$ similar to **comparison of views** in [[#Comparison]]

*What is the tone? What is the language used?*
~ Tone is **critical/unhappy**
~ Source is **straight to the point**
~ Language used is **objective**
~ Language used is **subjective**

*How does tone / language used proves the Source's (im)partiality?*
~ Source dedicated to throw hate towards XXX with a ==one-sided viewpoint==. Since it is ==biased== and ==one-sided==, Source is ==unreliable==.

~ Source is backed up by ==facts==. Therefore, it is ==reliable==.

~ Source is supported by only ==opinions==, and isn't supported by facts. Therefore, it is ==unreliable==.
>[!danger] It is important to note that ==objectiveness== > ==balance==
>Source might be ==biased==, but it may be ==supported by facts==, and can be ==true==

>[!danger] ==one-sided== not always = to unreliable
>Depends on source

#### Viewpoint
Similar to [[#Tone and Language]], viewpoint can be
- pessimistic VS objective (pessimistic is one-sided yet might be factual, objective gives two viewpoints)

### Guiding format
1. IEE on Base Source
    - Usefulness based on what it says
    - ==SAFETY NET==
2. IEE on another Source
    - Usefulness based on cross-reference
    - ==SAFETY NET==
3. Base Source
    - Usefulness based on provenance, motive, tone, or language
    - ==ATTEMPT FOR HIGHER MARKS==

## Evaluative
Sources with the same stand MUST NOT have the same elaboration/explanation and conclusion

E.g. ~~Sources A and B says minimum wage is bad as businesses lose employees~~

### Bonus marks [2]
1. Reliability/Usefulness
2. Contextual knowledge
3. Balanced conclusion
    - Don't summarise your points, just evaluate like geography SRQ
