## Differing needs and interests
Society has diff. people
$\rightarrow$ diff. needs and interests
$\rightarrow$ ==disagreement== on what is $\uparrow$ important for society

Society
- can probably **agree** on ==basic needs== (e.g. shelter, clothes, etc.)
- **cannot agree** on ==common interests== and what is crucial to have a ==happy and fulfilling life==

>[!summary] **Example**: Construction of Cross Island Line
>When it is decided to drill through the ==Central Catchment Reserve== to make way for the construction, there was much debate against and for it
>- ==Nature groups== opposed to this idea as the environment in the nature reserve would be damaged
>- ==Working population== supported the idea as their daily commute would be shortened -> more convenience for their daily lives

**Limited** resources in society -> **impossible** to meet **everyone**'s needs and interests

==Decisions will have to be made to determine how resources should be used==

## Differing priorities
Society may
- **agree** that
     - affordable healthcare
     - good education
     - clean environment
     are important
- may **not agree** on which factor to ==prioritise==

>[!summary] **Example**: Survey on Singaporeans (of differing income groups) from 1 Dec 2012 to 31 January 2013
> Survey on what the government should prioritise
>- People with monthly salaries ==**>$5,000**== think that **public healthcare** should be the top priority
>- People with monthly salaries ==**<$5,000**== think that **public housing** should be the top priority

Society is **diverse**
$\rightarrow$ ==diff. people== will think the government should focus on ==diff. areas==
$\rightarrow$ ==diff. priorities==

Since resources are **limited**
$\rightarrow$ government have to **make decisions** on **how** the resources should be used, ==though meeting everyone's demands is difficult==

## Unequal sharing of costs
Infrastructure development is **beneficial** to almost everyone in society
But some have to ==give up more in return== for the construction of it

>[!summary] **Example**: Construction of the Thomson-East Coast line
New MRT line would make travelling even more convenient for all members of society
But some people have to ==bear the costs of the construction more==
>
Residents in ==Marine Parade== have to
>- deal with the construction noises
>- give up their land (for some)

Singapore has little land
$\rightarrow$ facilities will inevitably be built near people's homes
$\rightarrow$ some residents have to ==bear the costs more than others==
