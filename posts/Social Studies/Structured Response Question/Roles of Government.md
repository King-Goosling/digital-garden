### Ensuring justice
Recall ![[Management of challenges#^f578e9]]

>[!example] Judiciary created the ==Family Justice Court== to ensure justice
>- takes action to ==protect SG== if there's family violence
>- provides definitions to ==determine what is considered as family violence==
>- provides guidelines on how to apply for ==Personal Protection Order== (protects victims of family abuse while they sue their aggressors)
