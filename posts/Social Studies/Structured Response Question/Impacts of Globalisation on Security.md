## Impacts of Cyber security challenges
*Why do cybercriminals conduct cyber attacks?*
### Government
- gain access to secret info
- attack critical infrastructure (e.g. water treatment plants, transport systems, etc.)
>[!example] Hacktivists defaced the webpage of ==Prime Minister's Office== and ==Istana== in ==2013==
### Business
- steal trade secrets
- steal money
### Individuals
Malware used to
- collect personal info (through computers, phones, social media, etc.)
    $\rightarrow$ attack individual using personal info (e.g. blackmail)
## Management of Cyber security challenges
$\uparrow$ cybercrimes
$\uparrow$ need for improving cybersecurity
>[!example] Singapore launched ==National Cyber Security Masterplan 2018==
>- $\uparrow$ increase no. of cyber security experts in SG
>- $\uparrow$ increased promotion of ensuring cybersecurity among businesses and individuals
>- $\uparrow$ strengthen infrastructure of cyber security
>
>Less prone to cyber attacks
>$\rightarrow$ **cyber security in SG strengthened**
## Impacts of Transnational terrorism
### Backlash against Muslim community
Terrorist groups use biased representations of Islams to justify their cause
$\uparrow$ **no. of anti-Islamic hate crimes**
>[!example] Anti-Islamic hate crimes peaked in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks
### Self-radicalisation
Rise of '**lone wolves**'

Individuals
- who aren't ==members of organised terrorist groups==
- BUT have been ==inspired== and ==radicalised== by **extremist propaganda** via social media and the Internet
>[!example] Truck attack in Nice 2016 
>Self-radicalised man drove a truck into the crowd
>$\rightarrow$ loss of lives
## Management of Transnational terrorism
### Preventive measures
- Collaboration between countries
- Build strong, cohesive and secure country
- Effective border controls
>[!example] ==ICA== uses **biometric technology** to regulate movement of people entering and leaving SG
>$\uparrow$ difficulty for terrorists to bypass border security
 
### Protective measures
$\uparrow$ vigilance through $\uparrow$ surveillance
>[!example] ==SAF== stationed at important areas of Singapore like ==Jurong Island==
>Jurong Island has a lot of petrochemical industries (important for SG's economy)
>$\uparrow$ security of those area
>$\downarrow$ chances for terrorists to invade and take control over that area

### Responsive measures
hold emergency preparedness exercises
>[!example] ==Exercise Heartbeat== is held **annually** in SG
>==Home Team== work together with the ==community== to deal with terrorist attack scenarios
