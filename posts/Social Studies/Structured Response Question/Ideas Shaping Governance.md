## Having Good Leadership
Leader must have ==moral courage==, be ==honest & capable==, and be ==incorruptible & of good morale==

>[!summary] **Example**: Implementation of ERPs in 1998
>Singaporeans have to pay more
>$\rightarrow$ unhappy
>
>BUT
>
>$\downarrow$ Traffic congestions on roads
>$\downarrow$ time taken for commute
>$\rightarrow$ convenience to all
>
>- Government has ==moral courage== to do what is **right**, even though it is **unpopular** (due to unhappiness)

- ==Honest and capable==
     - Implement policies that is best for society
- ==Incorruptible and of good morale==:
    - People will have **confidence** and **respect** in government
    - Choose what is good for **society** > Choose what is good for **themselves** (selflessness)

## Anticipating Changes and Staying Relevant
Making decisions for the **long-term benefit**
$\rightarrow$ **short-term disadvantages** may arise
$\rightarrow$ govt. realises this
$\rightarrow$ govt. identifies possible actions to ==mitigate== them

>[!summary] **Example**: 2 Integrated Resorts built in Marina Bay Sands and Sentosa
>**Reason**: SG has to stay ==relevant== as a tourist attraction (other countries are catching up in relevance)
>>[!fail] Long-term benefit: $\uparrow$ revenue from tourism
>
>>[!success] Disadvantage: $\uparrow$ gambling addiction
>>SGrens are esp. concerned about this
>>>[!hint] Mitigation
>$\rightarrow$ government **resolve issue** by implementing extra entry fees for Singaporeans in casino

If **forward-looking**
$\rightarrow$ will be efficient in ==mitigating== the disadvantages when a problem arises in the future
$\rightarrow$ country won't face many ==severe== disadvantages

## Providing a Stake for Everyone
Provide citizens
- a say in decision-making for the country

>[!summary] **Example**: ==REACH== government feedback system in ==1985==
>Aims to give citizens a chance to ==discuss about the issues in Singapore==
>
>Government **actively responding** to concerns in drafting of bills
$\rightarrow$ citizens realise that concerns and views are heard and taken into account by government
$\rightarrow$ feel that they are ==important== in shaping Singapore's future
$\rightarrow$ **==cultivate sense of attachment==**
$\rightarrow$ participate actively
$\uparrow$ efforts in the **contribution** to society
$\rightarrow$ government is more sure on the public's wants (==areas for **improvement** and **change**== are pointed out)
$\rightarrow$ better decisions can be made (policies are **improved**, **changed**, and **more effective**)

- home ownership
>[!summary] **Example**: Public Housing Scheme
>Allows citizens to own a piece of land at an ==affordable price==
>$\rightarrow$ citizens can own a land on Singapore
>$\rightarrow$ have a land to defend in Singapore (if land at stake)
>$\rightarrow$ **==cultivate sense of belonging==**
>$\rightarrow$ motivated to work for greater good for Singapore (so that land would be safe)

## Practising Meritocracy
System that
- rewards
    - hard work
    - talent
    - effort
- regardless of
    - race
    - religion
    - class
    - gender

>[!summary] **Example**: ==Edusave Scholarship== and ==Merit Bursary Scheme==
>Students encouraged to ==work hard in their academics== to achieve these rewards
>
>$\uparrow$ **capable** when grown up
>- $\rightarrow$ can **drive Singapore's progress** in the future as meaningful citizens
>- $\rightarrow$ ensure future leaders of Singapore will be **capable**

**Everyone has $=$ chance to succeed, only limited to amount of effort put in**
$\rightarrow$ members of society continue to work hard (in order to get rewards)
$\uparrow$ effort to ==improve society==
