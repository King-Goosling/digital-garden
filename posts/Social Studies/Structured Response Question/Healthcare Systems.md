## Market-based approach in US
Gives citizens the freedom to decide standard of healthcare and how much they want to spend on it (**minimal govt. intervention**)

Allows market to decide on provision of services for healthcare needs (healthcare providers set prices)
$\rightarrow$ healthcare costs vary significantly
>[!example] Medicaid
>Health insurance for lower SES people and people with disabilities
>
>However, still $\uparrow$ cost of medical insurance

>[!success] Benefits
>Govt. services can be easily overwhelmed, esp. for a large country like US
>So, govt. delegate some roles to private companies
>$\downarrow$ strain on govt.
>AND
>$\downarrow$ govt. budget spent on healthcare
>$\uparrow$ **govt. budget for other sectors** (e.g. education and infrastructure)

>[!fail] Challenges
>1. $\uparrow$ cost of healthcare insurance
>$\uparrow$ **people from lower SES remained uninsured**
>2. Insurance companies, especially the profit-driven, prefer to insure ==healthy== and ==employed== (to $\uparrow$ profits)
>$\uparrow$ **people from lower SES remained uninsured** (they are denied by insurance companies)
## Shared responsibility in SG
Combination of
- personal and collective responsibility
- govt. provision
>[!success] Benefits
>1.
>>[!example] varying classes of wards in hospitals with varying amounts of luxuries and conveniences
>>people can choose which class of ward they want
>>$\rightarrow$ **freedom to choose how much you want to spend on healthcare**
>
>2.
>>[!example] Medifund
>>Fund for those who cannot afford to pay for their healthcare
>$\uparrow$ subsidies for people with $\downarrow$ income
>$\uparrow$ **affordability of healthcare for all**

>[!fail] Challenges
>Insurance is earned by working population. So,
>$\uparrow$ growing ageing population
>$\uparrow$ growing demand of healthcare
>$\uparrow$ govt. budget spent on healthcare
>$\downarrow$ **govt. budget for other sectors** (e.g. education and infrastructure)
## Govt-financed in Sweden
Govt. provides subsidies and services for most healthcare needs

Choice of private insurance
>[!success] Benefits
>1. **affordable and even free** healthcare
>$\downarrow$ employees fall sick
>$\uparrow$ days that employees can work
>$\uparrow$ **productivity**
>2. universal healthcare
>$\rightarrow$ **equal access** to healthcare services regardless of social class, income, place of residence

>[!fail] Challenges
>1. $\uparrow$ ageing population
>$\uparrow$ money spent on subsidising healthcare
>$\uparrow$ taxes in form of Value Added Tax (VAT)
>$\uparrow$ **strain on working population**
>>[!example] VAT is 25% in Sweden
>
>2. $\uparrow$ immigrants coming to Sweden
>$\uparrow$ population in Sweden needing healthcare
>$\uparrow$ demand for healthcare
>$\uparrow$ money spent on subsidising healthcare ==(healthcare costs subsidised for immigrants too)==
>$\uparrow$ **strain on working population** ==(immigrants don't need to pay VAT)==
>
>3. Since healthcare is affordable and even free
>$\uparrow$ people will seek for healthcare services for ==minor illnesses==
>$\uparrow$ demand for healthcare
>$\uparrow$ money spent on subsidising healthcare
>$\uparrow$ **strain on working population**
