## Impacts on countries
### 👍 Economic growth
Due to $\uparrow$ **trading** + **expansion** of businesses in diff. parts of world

>[!summary] **Example:** Singapore and USA signed Free Trade Agreement in 2004
include trading of ==electronics and information technology==, ==petrochemicals==, ==chemicals== and ==textiles==
>
$\uparrow$ **variety** of goods and services for consumption
$\uparrow$ **tax revenue** + $\uparrow$ **employment opportunities** (to manufacture goods and services)
$\rightarrow$ country's economy **strengthened**
$\rightarrow$ ==economic activities diversified== ($\uparrow$ money, $\uparrow$ purchasing power, $\uparrow$ money spent)

### 👎 Sensitive to economic downturns
Changes in economy is **very reliant** on trade and investments between countries - if one country faces an ==economic downturn==, **many** other countries would be **negatively impacted** as well

>[!summary] **Example**: Global Financial Crisis in 2007-2008
>US-owned ==Lehman Brothers== bankrupt
>$\rightarrow$ global recession (due to US' large role in international economies)
>$\rightarrow$ many international banks (which income was obtained from investments in the US) forced to close down
>
>==Economic downturns that would have been limited to some countries, now affect many other countries due to globalisation==

## Impacts on companies
### MNCs (Multinational Corporations)
#### 👍 Larger market shares
MNCs can ==expand to more countries== thanks to globalisation
$\uparrow$ customer pool
>[!summary] **Example**: ==CapitaLand==, a Singaporean company, has expanded to ==>40 countries==
>Globalisation
$\uparrow$ countries that companies can reach out to
$\rightarrow$ greater access to more customers to buy from the company
$\uparrow$ profit

#### 👍 Higher profits
Labour costs can be ==cheaper in some countries==

Globalisation allow companies to ==expand to these countries== to
$\downarrow$ labour costs
$\uparrow$ their profits
>[!summary] **Example**: iPhone, an American company, is produced in China
>Labour costs in China < Labour costs in West
>$\rightarrow$ production costs can be **minimised**
>$\rightarrow$ profit can be **maximised**

#### 👎 Increased competition
$\uparrow$ companies expanding abroad
$\rightarrow$ ==competition== between them (esp. when the companies are specialised in the same field)
>[!summary] **Example**: Nokia and Apple
>After Apple's release of the iPhone
>$\rightarrow$ global sales of Nokia mobile phones **dropped significantly** (due to their inferiority to the iPhone which had more features)
>$\rightarrow$ Nokia is eventually **forced to close down**
>
>A company has to
>- **innovate continually**
>- **keep up** with changes of competitors
>- remain **relevant**
>
>in order to **not fall behind** and get **eliminated** (forced to close down) and **succeed**

### SMEs (Small Media Enterprses)
#### 👍 Economic benefit thanks to growth of MNCs
Due to globalisation,
$\rightarrow$ MNCs benefit economically
$\rightarrow$ SMEs benefit economically (by providing ==components, goods and services== to the MNCs)
>[!summary] **Example**: Local-based MMI Holdings (SME) and US-based Seagate Technology (MNC)
>MMI Holdings $\ce{->[provides hard drive discs]}$ Seagate Technology
>
>MNCs require a lot of supplies due to their **large-scale** operations
>$\rightarrow$ SMEs can sell supplies to these MNCs at a **higher** price
>$\rightarrow$ profit is earned

#### 👎 Threatened by MNCs
Globalisation
$\rightarrow$ brings MNCs into Singapore
$\rightarrow$ ==foreign competition== for local SMEs, which the SMEs are incapable in dealing it. 
>[!summary] **Example**: ==Local hardware chain Home-Fix== had closed all stores in Singapore due to the overpowering MNCs specialised in hardware
>In the competition between MNCs and SMEs, one must
>- **innovate continually**
>- **keep up** with changes of competitors
>- remain **relevant**
>
>Funds and supplies of SMEs < Funds and supplies of MNCs
>$\rightarrow$ SMEs cannot keep up with development in products of MNCs
>
>Entry of MNCs
>$\rightarrow$ SMEs **outcompleted** by MNCs
>$\rightarrow$ forced to close down

## Impacts on individuals
### 👍 Better job prospects and higher income
Globalisation
$\rightarrow$ allow people to have a **greater access** to other countries
$\rightarrow$ people can easily search for ==better job prospects== and ==higher income==

>[!summary] **Example**: ==NTU Engineers== have been headhunted for a job in ==Dubai==
>which offers ==**x3**== the pay of that in Singapore +  **better** ==living standards==
>
>

### 👎 Loss of job opportunities
- With a **greater access** to foreign jobs, local jobs can be sought by foreigners, leading to an ==increased competition== for jobs. As such, job opportunities could be **lost** to the foreigners if lost in the competition

- Jobs offered by MNCs might be **lost easily** as well

>[!example] **Example**: ==Uniqlo== move production sites from ==China== to ==Vietnam== due to $\downarrow$ labour costs there
>$\rightarrow$ loss of jobs in China
>
>MNCs might move operations in order to seek for high profits
>$\rightarrow$ jobs in MNCs would be lost (if operations discontinue in original country)
>OR
>$\uparrow$ competition (if operations continue in original  countries)
>$\downarrow$ job opportunities
