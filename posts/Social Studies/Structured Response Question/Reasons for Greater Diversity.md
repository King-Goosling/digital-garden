## Immigration policy
Determines ease of citizenship of immigrants. It can
- $\downarrow$ decrease no. of immigrants if we have too less resources available to be used on them
- encourage immigration to a country so as to $\uparrow$ increase manpower

>[!example] Singapore's birth rate started decreasing in ==1980s==
>If $\downarrow$ population,
>$\downarrow$ manpower,
>$\downarrow$ labour supply
>$\rightarrow$ economic growth will slow down
>
>So, to $\uparrow$ manpower, immigration policy is eased so
>$\uparrow$ immigrants in Singapore,
>$\uparrow$ manpower,
>$\uparrow$ labour supply,
>$\rightarrow$ economy will continue to improve and develop

>[!example] ==>7000== Multinational Corporations (MNCs) set up operations in SG
>SG has **world-renowned business efficiency**
>$\rightarrow$ SG becomes more attractive as **international business hub** to MNCs
>$\uparrow$ job opportunities (esp. from MNCs) readily available
>$\uparrow$ migrants and immigrants come to SG due to job opportunities

## Socio-cultural environment
