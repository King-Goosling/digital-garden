A policy where immigrants are expected to ==adopt beliefs and practices== of the majority group in a country
$\rightarrow$ identity of immigrants ==diminishes== and ==becomes similar== to that of the majority group

**Secularism** in France
- no religion is favoured over the other
- Church is kept seperate from State

==$\uparrow$Immigrants are expected to follow this belief $\uparrow$==

>[!example] Education
>- ==no discussion== of religion (except during History and Philosophy classes)
>- ==adaptation classes== for children of immigrants
>     - improve their **French**
> - religious symbols ==banned== (in schools)

>- introduction of the ==Diversity Charter==
>     $\uparrow$ **greater diversity** in workplace
>     $\rightarrow$ alleviates **discrimination** in hiring practices

>[!example] Naturalisation processes
>compulsory for immigrants to
>- attend ==French language== course
>- attend ==civic education== (to learn about life in France)
>- pass ==French Cultural Test==

>[!success] Benefits
>1. **Homogenous population**
>$\rightarrow$ all French nationals have ==common culture and language==
>$\rightarrow$ social cohesion strengthened
>
>2. **French nationality ==strengthened== rather than ==diluted==**

>[!fail] Disadvantages
>1. [Stand 1] Immigrants can no longer practice their religious practices
>$\rightarrow$ individuals' ==loss of rights== (to practice their religion)
>

>>Immigrants protest to regain their rights
>>$\rightarrow$ **social unrest**
## Integration in SG
A policy where immigrants can ==retain their unique identities== while ==forging common ground== with the locals
>[!example] **Naturalisation initiatives** like the ==Singapore Citizenship e-Journey==
>is an online journey which allows new citizens to ==learn more== about SG, at their ==own pace== and ==convenience==
>$\rightarrow$ new citizens can **better understand** how to integrate into the SG society

>[!example] **Common experiences** like ==National Service==
>Male 2nd-gen PRs must dedicate 2 years to serve the nation along with locals
>$\rightarrow$ develop ==sense of collective interest above self==
>$\rightarrow$ strengthen **sense of national identity**

>[!example] Community support
>1. ![[Reasons for Greater Diversity#^55a035]]
>2. PAP hosts integration events in neighbourhoods (e.g. celebrations like Christmas, Chinese New Year, etc.)
>$\rightarrow$ immigrants bond with neighbours
>$\rightarrow$ immigrants integrate into society

>[!success] Benefits
>Immigrants can build ==sense of national identity== and still have their ==unique identities==
>$\rightarrow$ ==diverse== SG society

>[!fail] Disadvantages
>1. $\uparrow$ immigrants come to SG
>$\uparrow$ job competition with immigrants
>$\downarrow$ **job security** for locals
>2.
