# CH20 Magnetism
## Properties of Magnets
1. Attract magnetic materials
2. Have two poles
3. Rests in north-south direction when freely suspended
4. Like poles repel, unike poles attract

>[!tip] Only magnets repel
## Magnetic Induction
#### Terms
Iron bar becomes an ==induced magnet==
Magnet magnetises iron bar by ==induced magnetism==
#### Example

##### How are paper clips magnetised?
Induced magnetism ==does not require physical contact==. Magnetic material only requires ==being near== the magnet.

##### Why did the paper clips repel at their bottom?
Magnet magnetised paper clips by induced magnetism, with
Top: Induced south pole
Bottom: Induced north pole

Since like poles repel, paper clips repel at their bottom.

#### Definition of Magnetic Domains
$\rightarrow$ consist of ==atomic magnets== pointing in ==same direction== (magnet contains atoms)

#### How does magnetic induction work (in terms of magnetic domains)?
1. Initially, magnetic domains in magnetic material point in ==different and random directions==
2. When brought close to a magnet, magnetic domains point in the ==direction of magnetic field==
![[Pasted image 20220724181536.png|200]]
3. N and S poles ==cancel each other out==
4. N and S poles at the **end** ==aren't cancelled out== $\rightarrow$ N and S poles of magnetic material produced

>[!hint] Atomic magnets at respective ends tend to ==fan away from each other== (like poles repel)

## Methods of Magnetisation
1. [[#Stroking]]
2. [[#Using D C]]
#### Stroking
![[Pasted image 20220717172245.png|200]]

#### Using D.C.
Use right-hand grip rule to determine poles
## Methods of Demagnetisation
1. [[#Heating]]
2. [[#Hammering]]
3. [[#Using A C]]
>[!danger] Important note: Carry out demagnetisation with magnet in E-W direction
>Ensure magnetic domains do not realign in N-S direction
#### Heating
$\rightarrow$ atoms in magnetic ==vibrate vigorously==
$\rightarrow$ alignment of magnetic domains is lost
#### Hammering
$\rightarrow$ alignment of magnetic domaines is altered and lost
#### Using A.C.
$\rightarrow$ alternating current magnetises magnet in different directions
    $\rightarrow$ repeated alterations, repeated change in directions of magnetisation
$\rightarrow$ alignment of magnetic domains is lost
## Magnetic Fields
![[Pasted image 20220724144140.png|300]]
Magnetic field lines directed from ==N== to ==S==
(can be dotted/solid lines)
![[Pasted image 20220724181723.png|300]]
==Position of X== differs with the ==difference of magnetic field strength== between the two magnets

#### Magnetic field strength
$\uparrow$ distance from magnet
$\downarrow$ conc. of magnetic field lines
$\downarrow$ magnetic field strength
![[Pasted image 20220810232951.png|300]]
#### Terms
Magnetic field: A region ==surrounding a magnet== which causes ==magnetic material== in it to experience ==magnetic force==

Magnetic field lines: Used to visualise **magnetic field**

Magnetic field pattern: Formed by a group of **magnetic field lines**
#### Plotting
1. Sprinkle iron fillings around magnet ==(NO direction shown)==
2. [[#Use compass]] ==(direction shown)==
##### Use compass
1. Place bar magnet at the centre of paper. Ensure that N of magnet is pointed to Earth's magnetic N.
2. Place compass near the N of magnet.
3. Mark S of compass as X and N of compass as Y on the paper.
4. Move compass such that its S is at Y.
5. Repeat steps 3 to 4 until compass reaches S of magnet.
6. Join dots plotted with a line.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 with the compass at different positions near the N of magnet
### Magnetic Shielding
![[Pasted image 20220724144511.png|300]]
1. Magnetic fields from N will enter the **left side of iron ring** and pass through via **iron ring** instead of **air**
2. Magnetic fields will be ==concentrated== in the iron ring
3. Magnetic fields will exit from **right side of iron ring** and to S

Shielded area will ==not experience magnetic field== (great for equipments that's sensitive to magnetic field)
### Magnetic Keepers
![[Pasted image 20220724144834.png|300]]
Because of ![[#^917475]]
magnets will become weaker after some time.

Magnetic keepers help to ensure that ==magnetic domains remain aligned in same direction== and atomic magnets at respective ends ==won't continue to fan away from each other==

## Temporary and Permanent Magnets
| Magnetic material      | Property                   | Example | Usage                                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Soft magnetic material | Easy to (de)magnetise      | Iron    | Temporary magnets (==magnetic door of fridge== and ==electromagnets==)     |
| Hard magnetic material | Difficult to (de)magnetise | Steel   | Permanent magnets |
