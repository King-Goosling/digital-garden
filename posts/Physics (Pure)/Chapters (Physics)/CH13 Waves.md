# Waves
-> consists of tranverse waves and longitudinal waves
-> transfers ==energy== without ==transferring matter==

## Tranverse waves
![[Pasted image 20220509222601.png|500]]
-> Direction of oscillation of particles is **perpendicular** to wave motion
-> P and S are ==crests==, R and U are ==troughs==
-> P&S; Q&T; R&U ==in phase== (moving in **same direction** + have **same displacement**)
E.g.: Electromagnetic waves, ripples on water

## Longitudinal waves
-> Direction of oscillation of particles is **parallel** to wave motion
E.g.: Sound waves

## Symbols
$\lambda$ (m) - wavelength (shortest distance between two points that are in phase)
$A$ (m) - amplitude (max. displacement from rest position)
$T$ (s) - period (time taken for one **complete oscillation/wave**)
$f$ (Hz) - frequency (number of **complete oscillations/waves** in one second)
$v$ ($ms^{-1}$) - wave speed
>[!danger] 'complete ==oscillations==' VS 'complete ==waves=='
>**Oscillation**: for particles
>**Waves**: for waves
## Formulae
$T= \frac 1f$
$f= \frac 1T$
$v=f \lambda$
$v= \frac \lambda T$
