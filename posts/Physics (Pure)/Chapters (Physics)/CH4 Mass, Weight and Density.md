# Mass, Weight and Density
## Mass
-> amount of matter in a body (kg)
-> scalar

## Weight
-> measure of gravitational force acting on a body (N)
-> vector

## Gravitational field
-> ==region== in which mass experiences **force** due to **gravitational attraction**

## Gravitational field strength
-> **gravitational force** acting **per unit mass** on an object (on Earth, $10Nkg^{-1}$ or $10ms^{-2}$)

-> affected by
    - **mass** ($W=mg$)
    - **distance** from object

## Inertia
-> refers to **reluctance** of object to **change** state of rest/motion due to its **mass**

-> depends on mass ($\uparrow$ mass, $\uparrow$ intertia)

## Density
-> mass per unit vol. of substance
$\rho = \frac mV$

### How to find density?
1. Measure $m$
	- Use beam/electronic balance

2. Measure $V$
	- Liquid: Measuring cyclinder
	- Irregular-shaped solid: Displacement method
	- Regular-shaped solid: Math formula

3. Calculate $\rho$ using $\rho = \frac mV$
