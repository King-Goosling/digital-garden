# Turning Effect of Forces
## Moment
-> Newton metre (Nm)
-> vector 
Moment $= F \times d$
where $d$ is **perpendicular distance** from ==pivot== to ==line of action of force==

## Principle of Moments (PoM)
For a body to be in equilibrium,

1. Sum of ðŸ”ƒ**clockwise** moments about a pivot $=$ Sum of ðŸ”„**anticlockwise** moments about same pivot

### Others (not PoM):
2. Resultant force (upwards and downwards) $=0$

## Centre of Gravity (CG)
-> point at which its whole weight appears to act
-> keep drawing lines of symmetry to find CG (if weight is evenly distributed)

## Equilibriums
### Stable equilibrium
- Tilted object **returns** to ==original position==
- ==Line of action through weight== falls **within** its base
- CG **raised** before falling

### Unstable equilibrium
- Tilted object moves **further** away from ==original position==
- ==Line of action through weight== falls **outside** of its base
- CG **lowers** and **continues** to do so

### Neutral equilibrium
- Tilted object neither ~~return~~ nor ~~move further away~~ from ==original position==
- ==Line of action through weight== **coincides** with ==point of contact==
- CG remains at **same** height

| Equilibrium          | Movement of tilted object                                               | Location of ==line of action through weight== | Change in CG                             |
