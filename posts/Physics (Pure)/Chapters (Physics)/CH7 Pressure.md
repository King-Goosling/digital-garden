# Pressure
-> force acting per unit area
-> Pascal ($Pa$) or Newton per area ($Nm^{-2}$)
$P= \frac FA$

## Pressure in liquids
$P=h \rho g$

$P_A > P_B$

## Pascal's Principle
-> **incompressible** liquid in ==enclosed body== allows pressure to be ==transmitted uniformly== throughout liquid

Equilibrium:
$P_1=P_2$
$\frac {F_1}{A_1} = \frac {F_2}{A_2}$

Based on [[CH6 Energy, Work and Power#u Principle of Conservation of Energy u|Principle of Conservation of Energy]],
$W_1=W_2$
$F_1 \times s_1 = F_2 \times s_2$ 
($F_1 \times d_1 = F_2 \times d_2$  in this case)
