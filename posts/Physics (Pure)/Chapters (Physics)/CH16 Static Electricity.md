## Electrostatic charging by friction
A and B are ==neutrally== charged

A and B rub together
-> A transfer ==negatively== charged particles to B
-> A become ==positively== charged, B become ==negatively== charged

## Electrostatic charging by induction
### Charging 2 conductors
1. Place conductors A and B side by side, **touching** each other, on ==insulating stands==

2. Bring negatively charged rod close to A, but not touching
    -> ==negative== charges **repelled** to far end of sphere B through ==**point of contact**==
    -> sphere A has **excess** ==positive== charges
    -> sphere B has **excess** ==negative== charges

3. Hold the ==insulating stand== of sphere B to pull it away from sphere A

4. Remove negatively charged rod. Spheres A and B
    -> have ==$=$ number== of opposite charges
    -> have been charged by induction

### Charging 1 conductor (negatively charged)
1. Place conductor A on an ==insulating stand==

2. Bring positively charged rod close to A, but not touching
    -> ==negative== charges **attracted**, and drawn close to positively charged rod
    -> excess ==positive== charges at other end of conductor A

3. Touch the far end of conductor A so that negative charges will be transferred from ground to conductor A (in order to neutralise the excess ==positive== charges, **earthing** conductor A

4. Remove ==hand== from conductor A

5. Remove positively charged rod
    -> negative charges **redistribute** themselves within conductor
    -> conductor is now ==negatively== charged

### Charging 1 conductor (positively charged)
1. Place conductor A on an ==insulating stand==

2. Bring negatively charged rod close to A, but not touching
    -> excess ==positive== charges at the end of A closer to positively charged rod
    -> ==negative== charges **repelled**, and drawn to other end of conductor A

3. Use an ==earth wire== to touch the far end of conductor A so that negative charges will be transferred from conductor A to ground, **earthing** conductor A

4. Remove ==earth wire== from conductor A

5. Remove negatively charged rod
    -> positive charges **redistribute** themselves within conductor
    -> conductor is now ==positively== charged

## Discharging
### Flame
Heat **ionises** nearby ==air particles== -> which **neutralise** ==excess charges== in object A

### Water molecules
**Impure** ater molecules are **electrical conductors** -> ==excess charges== **transferred** from object A to water molecules

### Earthing
Transfer excess negative charges from negatively charged object A, through body, and into earth through ==**point of contact**==

OR

transfer excess negative charges from earth, through body, and into positively charged object A through ==**point of contact**==

## Explanation: Neutrally charged object attracted towards negatively charged plate

In object, number of ==positively== charged particles $=$ number of ==negatively== charged particles

Excess ==positively== charged particles of object is located at the end of object, closer to ==negatively== charged plate. Due to $\downarrow$ distance, $F_{attraction}$ is stronger

Since **like charges repel**, ==negatively== charged particles of object **repel away** from ==negatively== charged plate, to the further end of the object, away from the ==negatively== charged plate. Due to $\uparrow$ distance, $F_{repulsion}$ is weaker.

As $F_{attraction}>F_{repulsion}$ , object **attracted** towards ==negatively== charged plate

## Electric Field

**Out** from ==positive== charge, **into** ==negative== charge

>Just draw 8 arrows in cardinal directions

**Electric force**:
==attractive/repulsive== force that electric charges ==exert on one another==

**Electric field**:
==region== in which an electric charge ==experiences== **electric force**

## Lightning
1. Friction between ==water molecules== in thundercloud and ==air particles== in atmosphere
    $\rightarrow$ thundercloud becomes **electrically charged**
2. ==Negative== charges gather at the **bottom of the cloud**
3. ==Negative== charges **repelled** away, causing **surface of the earth** to be ==positively== charged
4. After **accumulation** of charges, nearby ==air particles== can **ionise**, which provide a **conducting path** for ==negative== charges in the cloud to reach the ==positvely== charged earth surface
