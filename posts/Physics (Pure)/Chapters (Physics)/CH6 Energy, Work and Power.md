# Energy, Work and Power
## Energy
-> Capacity to do work
-> Joules (J)
-> Scalar

## Principle of Conservation of Energy
- Energy can neither be ==~~created~~== nor ==~~destroyed~~==
- Energy can be ==converted== from one **form** to another / ==transferred== from one **body** to another
- ==Total amount of energy== in an **closed/isolated** system is **constant**

## Efficiency
$=$ Useful energy output ($E_{out}$) $\div$ Total energy output ($E_{in}$) $\times$ 100%

>$E_{in} = E_{out} + E_{lost}$

## Work Done
-> Joule (J)
-> Scalar
$W=Fs$,
where $s$ is the distance moved by object in direction of $F$

$E_k= \frac 12 mv^2$
$E_p=mgh$

## Power
-> rate of work done
-> Watt (W) or Joules per second ($Js^{-1}$)
$P= \frac Wt$
