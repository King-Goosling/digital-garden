# Kinetic Model of Matter
-> states that [[CH1 Kinetic Particle Theory#^0a6835]]

## Brownian motion
-> continuous and random motion in a medium

## Characteristics of matter
[[CH1 Kinetic Particle Theory#Characteristics of Matter]]

## Pressure in a box
-> produced by collisions of gas particles with the walls of the box
    - when gas particle collides with the wall, it exerts a force on it
    - since $P= \frac FA$ , when $F$ is exerted, $P$ is produced

## Relationship of pressure ($P$), temperature($T$) and volume($V$)

>$\uparrow$ ==speed and kinetic energy==

>$\uparrow$ ==frequency of collisions (with wall)== since $\uparrow$  ==speed and kinetic energy== and $=$ ==distance between particles and wall== ($=V$)
