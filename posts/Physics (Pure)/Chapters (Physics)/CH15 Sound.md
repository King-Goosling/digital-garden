# Sound
-> travel at speeds of $343ms^-$ (usually)
## How is sound created?
Source of sound **vibrate vigorously** -> **displace** air molecules -> creates series of **compressions** (regions of higher pressure) and **rarefactions** (regions of lower pressure)

## How is sound propagated?
Air molecules **collide** with one another and **transfer** their energy, transfering the energy further and further away from the source of sound

## Audibility
Humans can hear ==20Hz== to ==20,000Hz==

Infrasound: <20Hz
Ultrasound: >20,000Hz (E.g.: Prenatal scanning)

## Pitch
$\uparrow$ $f$, $\uparrow$ pitch

## Loudness
$\uparrow$ $A$, $\uparrow$ loudness
