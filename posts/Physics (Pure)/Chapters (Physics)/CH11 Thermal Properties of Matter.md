# Thermal Properties of Matter
## Internal energy
-> sum of molecular ==kinetic== and ==potential== energy

==Kinetic==: **Vibration/Movement** of particles
==Potential==: **Bonding/Spacing** between particles


## Heat capacity
-> amount of thermal energy required to raise temp of body by 1K/1$\textdegree$ C
-> ($J \textdegree C^{-1}$ or $J K^{-1}$)
$C= \frac Q{\Delta \theta}$

## Specific heat capacity
-> amount of thermal energy required to raise temp of a ==unit mass== of body by 1K/1$\textdegree$ C
->($J \textdegree C^{-1}kg^{-1}$ or $J  K^{-1}kg^{-1}$)
$c= \frac Q{m \times \Delta \theta}$

## Latent heat of fusion
-> amount of thermal energy required for liquid to turn into solid and vice versa at ==constant temp==
-> (J)
$L_f$

## Specific latent heat of fusion
-> amount of thermal energy required for a ==unit mass== of liquid to turn into solid and vice versa at ==constant temp==
-> (J $kg^{-1}$)
$l_f= \frac {L_f}m$

## Latent heat of vaporisation
-> amount of thermal energy required for gas to turn into liquid and vice versa at ==constant temp==
-> (J)
$L_v$

## Specific latent heat of vaporisation
-> amount of thermal energy required for a ==unit mass== of gas to turn into liquid and vice versa at ==constant temp==
-> (J $kg^{-1}$)
$l_v= \frac {L_v}m$

## Why does evaporation cause cooling?
Molecules in liquid absorb thermal energy from surroundings
-> molecules at surface of liquid that are ==$\uparrow$ more energetic== can **overcome** attractive forces with other molecules
-> **escape** into atmosphere
-> ==less energetic== molecules left behind
-> ==average internal energy== of molecules decrease $\downarrow$
-> temp decreases $\downarrow$
