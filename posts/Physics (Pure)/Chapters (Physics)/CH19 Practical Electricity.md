# CH19 Practical Electricity
## Formulae
$\because P=\frac {W}t$ & $W=VQ$ ($V=\frac {W}Q$),
$P=\frac {VQ}t$

So,

$\because I=\frac {Q}t$,
$P=VI$

$\because I=\frac {V}R$,
$P=\frac {V^2}R$

$\because V=IR$ ($I=\frac {V}R$),
$P=I^2R$

### Recap on Power
[[CH6 Energy, Work and Power#u Power u]]

### Electrical energy ($E$)
-> SI unit of Joules ($J$) or Watts per second ($Ws^{-1}$)

$P=\frac{E}t$ $\rightarrow$ $E=Pt$ 
where $E$ ($J$/$Ws^{-1}$), $P$ ($Js^{-1}$/$W$), $t$ ($s$)

## Working
![[Pasted image 20220809223903.png|400]]
Find ==resistance== ($R$) first as it's constant

## Dangers of Electricity
1. [[#Damaged insulation]]
2. [[#Overloaded power sockets]]
3. [[#Damp environments]]

$\uparrow P = \uparrow I^2 \times R$
High current in wire -> Power in wire -> Heat in wire -> Fire hazards
### Damaged insulation

Insulating material gets ==worn/damaged== -> conducting wires become exposed

When conducting wires are touched, person may get an ==electrical shock== (electricity gets earthed)

### Overloaded power sockets
![[Pasted image 20220716175001.png|300]]
Source: https://cmregent.com/blog/overloaded-electrical-hazards-and-practices/

Large current flows through wires

Leads to ==overheating== and ==fire== may break out

### Damp environments

Impure water provides a ==conducting path== for current when come into contact with exposed electrical wires

When conducting water is touched, person may get an ==electric shock== (electricity gets earthed) by a large current since impure water has very low resistance ($R$)

$\uparrow I=\frac{V}{\downarrow R}$

==Short circuits== can happen, and current through wires increases

Leads to ==overheating== and ==fire== may break out

## Wires

| Live wire    | electrical supply (to have high voltage)      | [[#Circuit breakers]], [[#fuse]] and [[#switches]] fit here |
| Neutral wire | electrical supply (to complete circuit)       | no voltage ($0V$)                                           |

## Safety features
1. [[#Circuit breakers]]
2. [[#Fuse]]
3. [[#Switches]]
4. [[#Earthing]]
5. [[#Three-pin Plug]]
6. [[#Double insulation]]
### Circuit breakers

When large current flows through it, it will switch off electrical supply. Unlike [[#Fuse]], it doesn't need to be replaced after it ==trips==, and can be easily reset by ==clicking== on it

It is connected to ==live wire==

### Fuse
![[Pasted image 20220716221353.png|200]]

Same property as [[#Circuit breakers]], but it needs to be replaced after it ==blows==.

It is connected to ==live wire==

1. Fuse contains ==short and thin wire==
2. If too much current flows through it, it ==melts==
3. Circuit is ==open==, and current stops flowing

>[!info] Rating of fuse should be ==a little above== the rating of the electrical appliance

#### When will the fuse blow?

### Switches

Opens and closes the circuit

It is connected to ==live wire==

### Earthing
![[Pasted image 20220716222611.png|400]]

If live wire touches metal casing of appliance, metal casing becomes part of circuit

When conducting casing is touched, person may get an ==electrical shock== (electricity gets earthed)

With the earth wire, current will be earthed through the earth wire rather than the person (earth wire has $\downarrow R$ so current would rather flow there).

If a [[#fuse]] is installed, it can blow it so the person will not experience electric shock (open circuit).

### Three-pin Plug

Also known as ==safety plug==, it is used in Singapore

It consists of a cartridge fuse (fuse located in a cartridge) and earth wire. It makes use of [[#fuse]] and [[#earthing]]

### Double insulation
![[Pasted image 20220716223422.png|200]]
Source: https://dengarden.com/home-improvement/Waht-is-The-Ground-Wire-For

Some appliances does not have a [[#three-pin plug]], and makes use of ==double insulation== instead

1. Insulation between ==electric cable== and ==internal components==
2. Insulation between ==internal components== and ==outer casing==

Casings are ==non-metal== most of the time.
