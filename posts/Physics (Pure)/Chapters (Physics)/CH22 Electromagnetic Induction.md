# CH22 Electromagnetic Induction
## Solenoid
>[!summary] Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction
>$\epsilon \propto \frac{\Delta \phi}{\Delta t}$
>==magnitude of induced e.m.f.== in circuit is directly proportional to ==rate of change of magnetic flux== in circuit

>[!summary] Lenz's law
>==Direction== of induced e.m.f. and thereby induced current will be such that its magnetic effect **opposes** ==motion/change producing it==

If N/S of magnet goes towards solenoid, solenoid will try to **repel** it and has an induced N/S close to the solenoid.

If N/S of magnet goes away from solenoid, solenoid will try to **attract** it and has an induced S/N close to the magnet

Poles nearest to magnet:

|                | Towards | Away |
| -------------- | ------- | ---- |
| N pole closest | N       | S    |
| S pole closest | S       | N    |
### How to $\uparrow$ induced e.m.f.?
$\uparrow$ **no. of turns** in solenoid ==per unit length==
$\uparrow$ **strength** of magnet
$\uparrow$ **speed** at which magnet is moved ==with respect to solenoid==
## A.C. generator (alternating current generator)
mechanical energy $\rightarrow$ electrical energy

magnetic field + force (**input**) $\rightarrow$ current (**output**)
![[Pasted image 20220808213351.png|400]]
==current induced by changing magnetic flux==

current flows in ADCB $\rightarrow$ BCDA (according to Fleming's right-hand rule)

current is alternating in the circuit
### Fleming's right-hand rule
$\rightarrow$ used to find **current** when ==magnetic field== and ==force== is given

![[Pasted image 20220808182518.png|300]]
The three fingers must be perpendicular to each other
### How to $\uparrow$ induced e.m.f.?
1. $\uparrow$ no. of turns in coil
2. $\uparrow$ strength of magnet
3. $\uparrow$ $f$ of rotation
4. Wind coil around soft iron core ($\uparrow$ magnetic flux since magnetic field is more concentrated)

## Fixed coil generator
![[Pasted image 20220808213833.png|400]]
### Advantages
1. more compact
2. does not require **carbon brushes**
    $\rightarrow$ due to ==wear and tear==, contact between **slip rings** and **carbon brushes** ==erodes== over time
    $\uparrow$ resistance 
    $\uparrow$ heat produced
    $\uparrow$ power loss
## Faraday's Iron Ring Experiment
![[Pasted image 20220808214235.png|400]]
Since circuit is linked to a **D.C. supply**, there will ==**ONLY** be current induced momentarily== when the ==switch closed and opened==

**Closed**: compass needle deflects to the ==left== momentarily
**Open**: compass needle deflects to the ==right== momentarily
### Laminated core
thin sheets of soft iron insulated from one another

## Transformer
changes $\uparrow$ **high a.c. (with $\downarrow$ low V)** $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ **low a.c. (with $\uparrow$ high V)** (and vice versa)
![[Pasted image 20220808214534.png]]
**Step-down transformer**: Step down the V (from P to S) while $\uparrow I$
**Step-up transformer**: Step up the V (from P to S) while $\downarrow I$
### Formula
$\frac {V_S}{V_P} = \frac{N_S}{N_P}$ ratio of $V$ = ratio of $N$

${V_P}{I_P} = {V_S}{I_S}$  power in P = power in S (recall [[CH6 Energy, Work and Power#u Principle of Conservation of Energy u]])
OR $\frac {V_S}{V_P} = \frac{I_P}{I_S}$ ratio of V = (ratio of I)$^{-1}$

$\therefore \frac {V_S}{V_P} = \frac{N_S}{N_P} = \frac{I_P}{I_S}$
### Heat loss
$P_{loss}=I^2R$

**1. Increase thickness of cables**
$\downarrow R= \frac {\rho l}{\uparrow A}$ (recall [[CH17 Current Electricity#u Resistivity u]])
$\downarrow P_{loss}=I^2\downarrow R$

However, $\uparrow$ cable costs

**2. Use step-up transformer**
so $\uparrow V$ and $\downarrow I$

$\uparrow R=\frac{\uparrow V}{\downarrow I}$
$\downarrow P_{loss}=\Downarrow I^2\uparrow R$ ($I$ is squared)
$\therefore$ overall, $\downarrow P_{loss}$
## C.R.O (Cathode-Ray Oscilloscopes)
![[Pasted image 20220808214655.png|400]]
**Y-plates**: control y-axis
**X-plates**: control x-axis
### Usage
1. Measure V (by looking at Y-gain)
2. Display voltage waveforms (i.e. wave in $V$-$t$ graph)
3. measuring **short time intervals** (e.g. speed of echo)
### Graphs
**x-axis**: time base ==(ms/div)==
**y-axis**: Y-gain ==(V/div)==
>[!hint] ==position of 0V and 0ms== (aka the origin) **remains at the same position** although ==time base and y-gain is altered==
