# Temperature
-> degree of **hotness/coldness**

## Heat
-> amount of **thermal energy** flowing from hotter region to colder region

## Symbols
Celcius ($\degree C$ ) ==NOT SI UNIT==
- with **capital C** in both name and unit
kelvin  ($K$) ==SI UNIT==
- with **small k** in name and **capital K** in unit
$n \degree C = (n+273.15)K$

## Good thermometer
- easy to **read**
- **sensitive** to small changes in temp
- **safe** to use
- measure **wide** range of temp
- responsive to $\Delta \theta$ (**quick** to change)

## Constructing a thermometer
1. ==Thermometric== substances are used to **measure values** at 2 fixed points (melting ice and boiling water)
    - ==Thermometric==: **properties** of substance vary ==continuously== and ==linearly== with **temp**

2. Divide the two values into 100 intervals. Each interval is $1 \degree C$.

## Using thermometric properties to calculate temp

### Calibrated thermometer
$\theta \degree C= \frac {X_\theta -X_0}{X_{100} -X_0} \times 100 \degree C+X_0$
Where $X$ denotes ==length==

### Resistance thermometer
$\theta \degree C= \frac {\ohm_\theta -\ohm_0}{\ohm_{100} -\ohm_0} \times 100 \degree C+\ohm_0$
Where $\ohm$ denotes ==resistance==

### Thermocouple
$\epsilon \propto \Delta \theta$
$\rightarrow \epsilon = k\Delta \theta$
Where $\epsilon$ denotes ==e.m.f.==

Wires are of different material, usually **copper** and **iron**
1. Put **hot junction** in ==PURE boiling water==, and **cold junction** in ==PURE melting ice==
2. Once the reading on the **millivoltmeter** has stabilised, take e.m.f. measured and divide it by 100. Denote this value as $k$
3. Put **hot junction** in jet engine
4. Once the reading on the milliwoltmeter has stabilised, take e.m.f. measured and divide it by $k$. Temperature of jet engine is obtained.
#### Advantages
- responsive to $\Delta \theta$ (**quick** to change)
- it can measure **very high temperatures**
- it can measure areas that are **hard to reach** (which can be dangerous) to jet engines
