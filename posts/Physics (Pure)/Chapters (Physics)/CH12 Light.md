## Refractive index (n)
$n=$ speed of light in vacuum $\div$ speed of light in medium

$n= \frac {sin(i)}{sin(r)}$ 

## Critical angle (c)
$n= \frac 1{sin(c)}$

c< : Total Internal Reflection occurs
c> : refraction

>[!info] Optical fibre
>**Properties**
>- has a core with high $n$, coated with material of low $n$
>- uses ==light== to trasmit data
>
>**Advantages**
>- ==flexible== (even if bent, light will be internally reflected between the two materials)
>- can transmit $\uparrow$ ==**larger volume**== of data at $\uparrow$ ==**higher speed**== 
>- experience $\downarrow$ ==less loss of signal== as they don't lose heat
