# Current Electricity
## Electric current
-> measure of ==rate of flow of electric charge== through a given cross-section of conductor
-> ampere (A)
-> measured using ammeter, connected in **series**, with + to +, - to -
$I= \frac Qt$

>[!info] Convectional current is opposite of Electric current
>Convectional current is 'movement' of **positive charges**
>Electric current is movement of **electrons**

## Electromotive force (electrical energy source)
-> ==work done== by **power source** to drive **a unit charge** around a complete circuit [1] while converting other forms of energy into electrical energy [1]
-> volt ($V$) or joules per coulomb ($JC^-$)
$\epsilon = \frac WQ$,
where $\epsilon$ is e.m.f. of electrical energy source (like the 'strength' of souce)

## Potential difference (component)
-> ==work done== to drive **a unit charge** through the **component**
-> volt (V)
-> measured using voltmeter, connected in **parallel**, with + to +, - to -
$\epsilon = \frac WQ$,
where $\epsilon$ is the p.d. across component

## Resistance
-> ohm ($\Omega$)
$R= \frac VI$

## Ohm's law
==Current== passing through metal conductor is **directly proportional** to ==p.d.== across it
$I \propto V$

Ohmic conductors: Obey Ohm's law
Non-ohmic conductors: Do not obey Ohm's law

## Resistivity
$R= \frac {\rho l}A$
$\rho = \frac {RA}l$

where
$R=$ resistance of conductor
$\rho =$ resistivity of conductor (ohm metre $\Omega m$)
$A =$ cross-sectional area of conductor
$l =$ length of conductor

## Formulae
$R=\frac VI$
$I=\frac VR$
$V=IR$
