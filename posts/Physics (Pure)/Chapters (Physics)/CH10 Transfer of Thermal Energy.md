# Transfer of Thermal Energy
-> a net thermal transfer only occurs if there is a **difference** in temp, from ==region of higher temp== to ==region of lower temp==

-> **NO** net transfer of heat if two objects are at **thermal equilibrium** (means that two objects in ==contact== have the ==same== temp)

## Conduction
-> Thermal energy transfer by **molecular vibration** ==without any transfer of medium==

>One end of metal rod **heated**,
particles heated end **gains K.E.**$\uparrow$,
**vibrate** faster $\uparrow$,
collide more **vigorously** with ==neighbouring particles== $\uparrow$
==neighbouring particles== **vibrate** faster $\uparrow$

Process continues along rod to ==cooler end== -> ==whole rod== heating up

>[!info] Metals and their free $e^-$
Metals have free $e^-$ which **moves faster** when **heated**
free $e^-$ **diffuse** to ==cooler parts== of metal rod -> **transfer K.E.** to ==particles there==
>
>$\therefore$ Since non-metals don't have free $e^-$, metals conduct heat better than them

Solids are transfers thermal energy via conduction best as particles are very **tightly packed** -> $\uparrow$ **freq. of collisions**, as compared to that in liquids and gases

## Convection
-> transfer of thermal energy by means of **fluid movement** due to ==diff in density==

Cannot occur in solids as particles in solids **tightly packed** -> ==does not allow movement of particles== due to change in density

>1. Fluid near heat source gains heat$\uparrow$, expands, becomes $\downarrow$ less dense, $\uparrow$ rises
>2. Surrounding cooler and denser fluid sinks to replace the rising hotter fluid
>3. Restart process
>
>Movement of fluid sets up convection current

## Radiation
-> transfer thermal energy in form of **EM waves** like infrared radiation ==without aid of medium==

>[!info]
>- Thermal energy from infrared radiation is called ==radiant heat==
>- $\uparrow$ heat object has, $\uparrow$ ==radiant heat== emitted
>- Good ==emitter== of radiation is good ==absorber== of radiation

### Factors
**Colour and texture of surface**: ==Dull and black== surfaces > ==Shiny== surfaces (in emission and absorption of radiation)

**Surface temp**: $\uparrow$ surface temp (relative to surrounding temp), $\uparrow$ rate of emission of infrared radiation

**Surface area**: $\uparrow$ larger surface area, $\uparrow$ rate of emission/absorption of infrared radiation

>[!danger] Thermal energy transfer from a distance (conduction or radiation?)
>**Conduction**: ==Relatively short== distance away from energy source
>**Radiation**: ==Far== distance away from energy source
