## Magnetic field pattern around straight wire
### Description
![[Pasted image 20220810235022.png]]
Magnetic field consists of ==concentric circles==

Magnetic field lines are ==more concentrated near== the wire

Direction is determined using right-hand grip rule
### Symbols of direction of current flow in wire

## Magnetic field pattern around flat coil
### Same wire

## Fleming's left-hand rule
$\rightarrow$ used to find **force** when ==magnetic field== and ==current== is given

>[!hint] **F**ather, **m**other, **c**hild
>**F**orce
>**M**agnetic field
>**C**urrent

The three fingers must be perpendicular to each other

### How to $\uparrow$ force?
$\uparrow$ magnetic field strength
$\uparrow$ current

### Explanation
![[Pasted image 20220808211205.png|500]]
## D.C. motor (direct current motor)
electrical energy $\rightarrow$ mechanical energy

magnetic field + current (**input**) $\rightarrow$ force (**output**)

There's no current when coil is vertically up, but it conserves its momentum and continues to turn

**Carbon brushes**:
Allow ==moving parts== (split-ring commutator) to be in contact with ==non-moving parts== (wire)

**Split-ring commutator**:
Is attached to the coil

Has a split for it to ==lose contact== with the ==carbon brush== and create a ==reverse current== thereafter
